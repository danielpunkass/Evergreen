To recap, the issue will <strong>not</strong> affect any players who already have the game installed. So, if you are a LoL player with the game installed, there's nothing to worry about. If you're about to jump into the game for the first time on Mac, Riot strongly recommends that you should download the game before you install macOS Catalina (whenever that is released).</p>\n<p>As noted by Riot, it is unclear at this stage whether this is going to be an issue when Catalina is released. It is also unclear at this stage how long the problem might persist if indeed it does take effect. Most recent reports suggest Catalina <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apples-danish-website-suggests-macos-catalina-launching-october-4\">could be released Friday, October 4</a>, however Apple is yet to confirm a release date.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/JWyLk-_b5BM\" height=\"1\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Catalina might not support League of Legends on release","author":"Stephen Warwick","summary":{"content":"Image via Riot\nThis will only affect new installs, not current players\nWhat you need to know\nLeague of Legends may not work with macOS Catalina on release.\nRiot is unsure of compatibility due to broad release date.\nThe issue will not affect users who have the game already installed, only new downloads.\nRiot games has announced that users may not be able to install League of Legends on macOS Catalina upon its release.

A good old fashioned playground bully.</p>\n<p>I have mostly kept this story to myself for over a year, but I don’t feel I can continue to do so. It is destroying my peace of mind and making me feel terrible. I tried to ignore my feelings about this, hoping they would go away, but they have not. I need to share my story in order to move on from this.</p>\n<p>I’m not posting this because I want anyone to do anything about this specific incident. I just want people to listen and to understand. </p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>My first interaction with my bully was back in 2015. 2015 was the first year I really got into conference speaking. I had finished up school the year before and conference speaking was the only way I had to network and get my name out there in order to find a job.</p>\n<p>I was invited to speak at a conference in 2015 by a friend of mine. As many of you know, I used to be in an abusive marriage. My previous husband would not allow me to have money to buy textbooks while I was going to school for computer programming. My friend sent me books, watched my first shitty conference talk while it was being live streamed, and used his connections to try to help me find a job.</p>\n<p>My friend did this when I was nobody. I wasn’t an author yet. I didn’t have a blog. No one knew who I was. He helped me because it was a kind thing to do and he had no expectation that I would ever become anything. To me, the way someone treats you when they don’t get any benefit from it means a lot. I see way too many people who only network with people who are more visible than they are and tell anyone just starting out to fuck off. I don’t like those people.</p>\n<p>I was invited to speak at a conference my friend was organizing, but I could not make it because I found out my ex-husband had put us significantly in debt. I felt very sad about not being able to go.</p>\n<p>My friend also invited my bully to the conference. My bully could not go for different reasons than I had. They were very vocal about how unhappy they were with my friend regarding his handling of his conference. They started a Twitter mob against my friend and started a whisper network around him.</p>\n<p>I felt some loyalty to my friend after his working to help me before I had a career. I kept hearing people at conferences say how terrible it was that he was being attacked, but no one said anything. I was probably dumb, but I put my neck out to defend my friend because no one else would. I understood that my bully would be unhappy about my defense and I really did the best I could to say this whole thing was probably a misunderstanding, as is wont to happen when people communicate online.</p>\n<p>After I posted that post, the talk stopped. I thought I made a difference and got people to leave him alone. I now realize it’s probable that people were still talking about him, but that I had shown myself to be untrustworthy and thus no one included me in these conversations.</p>\n<p>I knew there would probably be repercussions for my actions, but I figured I did the right thing and I would feel morally okay with whatever the blowback was.</p>\n<h2>2018</h2>\n<p>Four years passed and I didn’t feel the blowback. I noticed I was never invited to a conference my bully was speaking at, but that was fine. I didn’t really care to interact with them. </p>\n<p>My luck ran out in 2018.</p>\n<p>A talk of mine was accepted at a conference. I had to spend nine months working on it. It was incredibly labor intensive, but I was happy to have the opportunity to speak.</p>\n<p>Three weeks before the conference, I saw that the conference organizers announced my bully would be a keynote speaker at the conference.</p>\n<p>I wrestled with what to do. I hadn’t had any contact with my bully in four years. I half hoped my bully had forgotten the whole incident and found someone else to be mad at about something. I thought about approaching the conference organizers about the situation, but I thought that would be petty. My bully hadn’t done anything so what would I complain about? What could they even do about it?</p>\n<p>I found out.</p>\n<p>Six days before the conference I was contacted on the conference Slack by the organizers telling me that they had to talk to me and had set a meeting for 10:00 the following morning. I kind of joked that I hoped I hadn’t done something wrong. They repeated that I was required to speak to them tomorrow morning at 10:00. They would not elaborate what had happened or what we would be speaking about. I had a sinking feeling this was about my bully. I was right.</p>\n<p>The organizers, looking like police interrogators, told me there had been a complaint about me. They said they did not want to hear my side of the story because they didn’t care and would not believe me. They told me they had stringent conditions I was required to follow if I was to be allowed to keep my slot at their conference:</p>\n<ul><li>I was not to be within 500 feet of my bully</li><li>I was not to be in the same room as my bully</li><li>I was not to speak to my bully</li><li>I was not to speak about my bully to anyone at the conference</li><li>I was not to attend a networking event my bully wanted to attend</li><li>I was not to tell anyone that this conversation happened</li></ul>\n<p>I was dumbstruck. I was not surprised my bully had complained about me. I was surprised at how I was being treated by the organizers. I considered them to be friends. I had had them to my house and they had slept under my roof. They met my parents and I had fed them food I made myself. I considered this to be a deep transgression of my hospitality and relationship with them.</p>\n<p>My initial inclination was to tell them to fuck off and that I would not attend their conference. I felt that this would have looked bad professionally. I spent nine months working on my talk and it could not be replaced easily. I was also bringing my now-husband with me. He had bought a conference and a plane ticket. I didn’t feel I could tell him that he wasted that money because I was being petty.</p>\n<p>So I swallowed my pride and faked my way through the conference. I spent most of the conference hiding in my room with my husband. I came out for my talks and for meals. I briefly saw my bully as I was taking my dog outside to walk her and I was terrified that they would complain about me violating the terms of my parole and have me kicked out before I could give my talk.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing that bothers me about this situation is that I had reported harassment two years earlier, the first time I attended their conference. Someone at the conference touched me inappropriately and tried to get me to take them back to my hotel room to have sex. I reported the incident and they didn’t believe me. They told me it was a misunderstanding, the perpetrator was European, and that I had misunderstood his intentions. I had to physically demonstrate on one of the organizers how I had been touched for them to take it seriously.</p>\n<p>So like sexual assault is just fine, but just make sure you don’t defend someone on Twitter? I wasn’t allowed to tell anyone about that incident either. My bad.</p>\n<h2>Aftermath</h2>\n<p>I tried to tell myself that none of this is important and that I didn’t care. I felt deeply foolish for thinking these people were my friends when they clearly didn’t feel that way about me. I felt like I had been conned and was too stupid to realize it until it was too late. I was angry about the number of hours I wasted working on their projects and I wanted that time back.</p>\n<p>I broke my agreement to not talk about this incident a few times with a few trusted friends in the community. Any time I tried to obscure the name of my bully, they always immediately knew who it was. No one I told was surprised any of this happened. They were always deeply sympathetic and told me that everyone knows how this person is.</p>\n<p>Imagine my shock to see my confidants going out of their way to socialize and interact with my bully. I would see them having long involved conversations on Twitter or being asked to collaborate on their side projects.</p>\n<p>I called one of them out about this. I reminded him about how I had been treated. His response was, “Yeah, but that has nothing to do with me. I can be friend with both of you and be Jonny in the Middle because I’m basically Switzerland.”</p>\n<p>At first I tried not to let this bother me. I didn’t want to tell my friends they had to choose between me and a bully because that seemed shrewish. Also mostly because I know that my side would not be chosen. But the longer this goes on, the more this bothers me.</p>\n<p>All of these people know this person is a bully. They know this person’s behavior is terrible. Conference organizers know that this person will ruin them on Twitter if they don’t do everything the bully says. So why do they keep giving my bully a platform? Why do they keep inviting the bully to speak and give them power and visibility? Why do they knowingly stick their neck in a noose and then punish anyone who threatens a situation where it might cut off their air?</p>\n<p>I kept thinking that one day someone would catch wise to this situation and they would stop inviting my bully to speak, but it hasn’t happened. I realized that it’s not because people don’t know this person is a bully. It’s because people don’t care. They don’t care that this person treats people badly because they get something out of interacting with them.</p>\n<p>That’s the piece that clicked into place that really made me feel I needed to talk about this. I knew my bully had mental health issues. Not that it’s an excuse for behavior. I don’t blame them for complaining about me to the conference organizers. I expected them to. I would not be surprised if my bully used their clout to keep me away from any conference they were at for so many years.</p>\n<p>The people I do blame are the ones who know this is happening and do nothing.</p>\n<p>I don’t know how I can continue to be friends with people who knowingly associate themselves with an abusive bully. I don’t know how they can feel that it’s okay for someone to ruin people’s lives as long as it’s not theirs.</p>\n<p>I also keep thinking about how this was how I was treated when <strong>I WAS A SPEAKER!!</strong> I keep thinking of all the people this bully might have damaged who didn’t have the clout/visibility I do. What if I had been an attendee? A student? How many people have had their careers damaged or left the community because they ran afoul of this person? We’ll never know.</p>\n<h2>What Do I Want Out of This?</h2>\n<p>Here is what I <strong>DON’T</strong> want out of this:</p>\n<ul><li>I don’t want anyone who figured out who these people are to harass them on Twitter in any capacity. That’s their MO, not mine.</li><li>I don’t want to start a feud. This is about me talking about my feelings, not trying to start some kind of retribution against anyone. I’m not trying to damage anyone’s business/living because I feel slighted. I just want to be able to speak openly about how this made me feel.</li><li>I don’t want an apology. The organizers made a calculated risk that they could treat me like shit and have nothing bad happen to them because I have no power to make their lives miserable and they were right. That burns me up a little, but it’s reality. I don’t want a fake apology from anyone trying to make themselves look better. The bridge is burned and it’s not coming back.</li></ul>\n<p>I do want two things out of this. The first thing is I just want to talk about how this made me feel. I feel deeply angry and hurt by this situation. I have bottled this up for over a year and I am tired of it. I kept telling myself I had no right to feel upset about this because there are kids locked in concentration camps along the border and the world is slowly microwaving to death. Being slighted at a conference is the most First World Problem there is. Also, I may be in the wrong here. What if I did something terrible and I was told not to tell because it would look bad for me? I know I should get over this and if I just keep trying to be a good person and ship projects that in the long run this doesn’t matter. But I feel I have the right to my anger and my pain regarding this.</p>\n<p>I want to be clear that I didn’t expect the organizers to tell my bully to fuck off. I was pretty sure my bully would complain about me, but I wish the organizers had handled their interaction with me differently. Instead of treating me like a pedophile caught next to a playground, I wish they had privately reached out and been like, “Hey, look. Someone complained about you. We know you’re cool. Do you mind just like avoiding them so that they don’t cause an incident?” I would have been like, sure, no problem. See you next week. They chose instead to completely burn our entire personal and professional relationship. It wasn’t necessary. They chose to do it. That kind of stings.</p>\n<p>I want to get over this. This is a festering wound that never heals and constantly reopens over nothing. I don’t trust people who were my friends. I don’t feel comfortable or trust anyone anymore. I am consumed with a desire to become so powerful that no one can ever fuck me over like this again. I hate feeling this way. I want to build things that make me happy. I want this to not bother me anymore.</p>\n<p>The second thing I want out of this is for people to realize there is no neutral position in a situation where someone is being bullied or harassed. If someone is being bullied because they disagreed with another person’s behavior towards someone else and they are being harassed, you don’t get to sit there and think, “Sucks to be them! Should have keep their mouth shut!” and still be a good person. </p>\n<p>There is a somewhat large subset of people on Twitter who feel that any kind of disagreement with them constitutes harassment. It does not. Hating someone isn’t justification for complaining about their presence at a professional event.</p>\n<h2>How to Handle Bullying</h2>\n<p>Here’s a handy guide to dealing with bullying.</p>\n<p>If you see someone being harassed, you gently insert yourself into the conversation and you tell the harasser that their behavior is inappropriate. The harasser must back off and apologize and the incident is over. There is no retaliation or blame from either party. It’s just over.</p>\n<p>If you see someone try to step between a harasser and someone else who is also being harassed, you don’t sit back smugly and think they should have kept to themselves. You step in and also assert that this behavior isn’t acceptable.</p>\n<p>This works even in the situations where people are afraid of being called out as creepy or socially awkward. If you are bothering someone and you don’t mean to, the person just wants the behavior to stop. Someone lets you know that you are bothering another person, you apologize, and you leave them alone. Kindergartners understand this. Had I been asked to apologize to my bully but be allowed free range of the conference, I would have been happy to do so. But the point was retribution not fear.</p>\n<p>Bullies are allowed to act the way they do because most people sit back and let it happen because they figure it’s nothing to do with them. It is to do with you. If you sit back and let people behave this way, you’re contributing to a hostile environment. Your friends see when you sit back and let them be treated like crap.

It's confusing.</p>\n<p>In November 2018, Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/cloudflare-launches-1111-mobile-app-its-dns-service\">introduced its 1.1.1.1 application</a>. It was a simple app that could move your phone's networking stack to use Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service instead of the one assigned by your internet service provider. Google does something very similar with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/\">its own public DNS service</a>, but Cloudflare's is faster so it made your connections feel more &quot;instant.&quot; The announcement also talked about something called WARP, which would be coming at a later date.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WARP is part of Cloudflare's existing app and not a standalone service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-warp-plus/\">That later date has arrived</a>, and WARP is now part of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone\">the 1.1.1.1 app</a>. So far, not too confusing, but that changes when the term VPN enters the fray. WARP is a VPN, but WARP isn't like any VPN you might be using now or have heard about.</p>\n<h2>What is DNS?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-cloudflares-warp-and-should-you-use-it\" title=\"What is Cloudflare's WARP VPN and should you use it?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2017/07/best-vpn-imore-hero-01.jpg?itok=vgFl-X1A\"></a></p>\n<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is used to convert familiar names like www.google.com into IP (Internet Protocol) addresses like 173.194.39.78.</p>\n<p>Your phone (or any other computer) can only connect to anything over the internet using numbers. DNS servers are used to translate the things we type into those numbers so we don't have to memorize them. They're often called the phone book of the internet. These servers, called nameservers, hold files that can look up names like microsoft.com or facebook.com so you can be connected when you type them into your browser or when an app calls for a site to be opened. There is no single computer that holds the billions of DNS records — instead, they are distributed on many machines all over the globe.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nameservers are the internet's phone book. Remember those?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The way nameservers are mapped means there are machines that hold lookup abilities for each TLD (Top Level Domain), which in turn has its own set of nameservers that has individual records. A TLD is the three letters like &quot;com&quot; or &quot;net&quot; that end a URL you type in.</p>\n<p>So you can imagine just how many different machines are used to look up what we all type and convert it into a string of numbers that our phones and computers can use to actually connect to anything on the internet. You can also imagine that some of these machines are super busy and can be slow. If you've ever typed in a web address and waited for a page to change or load, part of that waiting time was probably for the DNS resolution. Having nameservers that are not only faster but don't track requests, like Google or Cloudflare's offerings, is a really good thing.</p>\n<h2>What is a VPN?</h2>\n<p>You might think a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a network tool that keeps you more private on the internet or lets you access region-restricted content, but those are actually byproducts and not at all what a VPN was designed to do. A VPN was &quot;invented&quot; to allow you a direct and secure connection to a remote network through the internet. An example would be me using a VPN to connect to Mobile Nation's servers from anywhere and having the traffic tunneled through the regular internet without interacting with any of it. That's a real example we use every day, by the way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-vpn-services\" title=\"\">More: Save money with these great VPN deals</a></p>\n<p>A VPN doesn't even have to be encrypted and doesn't even hide your traffic — it simply changes who can see it. There are many great VPNs that <strong>do</strong> encrypt and anonymize your internet traffic, letting you browse the web privately and access all of its content. But those aren't the only kinds of VPNs and that can be confusing.</p>\n<h2>What is WARP?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-cloudflares-warp-and-should-you-use-it\" title=\"What is Cloudflare's WARP VPN and should you use it?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/665456-cloudflare-warp-logo-1aou.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>WARP is a VPN that doesn't hide your origin IP (where or who you are) but does encrypt your traffic and use Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service. It's rolled into the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone\">1.1.1.1 app</a> and shouldn't be considered a separate thing. The 1.1.1.1 app protects your DNS queries from being &quot;sniffed&quot; on local and unsecured networks, like the Wi-Fi router at your local Starbucks, and when WARP is activated from inside the app it adds a VPN encryption layer that adds to that protection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A VPN can bolster your online privacy, but that wasn't Cloudflare's original intent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is all the 1.1.1.1 app does, and it's not any good for hiding your location or browsing anonymously. It's not advertised to be either, and the terms of service even tell you that your original IP (the one your ISP gave you) is being reported to Cloudflare servers. Cloudflare also says it keeps that data for two years and never sells any of it.</p>\n<p>1.1.1.1 with WARP is free to use, but Cloudflare also offers a premium package called WARP+. WARP+ offers the same features as the free version with one handy extra — requests over the internet are routed through Cloudflare's network. Using a feature known as Argo Smart Routing, WARP+ can make sure the things you want to see aren't affected by network congestion. WARP+ pricing varies slightly based on location, which Cloudflare says was done to make sure it matches the cost of a Big Mac.</p>\n<p>If this isn't what you're looking for, don't use Cloudflare's DNS and instead use the one your ISP provides or Google's in tandem with another VPN product. There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-vpn-services\">great ones to choose from</a>.</p>\n<h2>Should I use this?</h2>\n<p>It's not going to hurt anything and it's not doing anything &quot;bad&quot; regardless of what you might have read on the internet. The problem is that Cloudflare uses the words &quot;VPN&quot; and &quot;not a VPN&quot; interchangeably and that makes the whole thing confusing as heck. Even folks who know how all of this works were a bit confused and had to figure out exactly what Cloudflare was doing and what it was offering with the addition of WARP to the 1.1.1.1 app.</p>\n<p>If you're not concerned about what DNS is or does and how nameservers or encryption work, think of the app as a little extra protection while on the internet, but not any sort of service that can hide your location or identity and you'll have a good handle on it all. Read the terms of service before you give the app the OK to start working and decide if its something you need.</p>\n\n<h4>Warp VPN</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-cloudflares-warp-and-should-you-use-it\" title=\"What is Cloudflare's WARP VPN and should you use it?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/10/warp-render-g7e.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627\" title=\"\">Free at App Store</a></p>\n<p>Cloudflare's VPN isn't a traditional VPN — it encrypts your data without hiding your origin, so it's not meant to be used to access geographically-restricted content or to get around other restrictions.

Here's how it does that according to Schiller.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It shoots nine images. Before you press the shutter button, it's already shot four short images [and] four secondary images. When you take the shutter button, it takes one long exposure. And in just one second, the neural engine analyzes the fused combination of long and short images picking the best among them, selecting all the pixels and pixel by pixel, going through 24 million pixels, to optimize for detail and low noise.</p>\n<p>This is the first time a neural engine is responsible for generating the output image. It is computational photography mad science. It's way cool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that was it. Apple didn't get into too much detail as the feature would not be available until a later time. It doesn't even mention it on its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F159229%2F554233%2F7613%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU58065YYr%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fiphone-11-pro%252F&token=8nZLrq_u\" title=\"\">iPhone 11 page</a>, but we imagine that will change shortly after the feature becomes available.</p>\n<p>The Deep Fusion process sounds daunting and amazing. The images Apple has released so far give us a good luck at the raw potential of the feature that takes full advantage of the new cameras in the <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-review\">iPhone 11</a>. It could help further seperate the iPhone 11 camera from the competition.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/G6fI7_uaX-A\" height=\"1\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Here’s everything Apple said about Deep Fusion during the iPhone event","author":"Danny Zepeda","summary":{"content":"What you need to know\nWith Apple set to release Deep Fusion via an iOS 13 developer beta update, lets take a look at what it said about the feature during the iPhone event.\nPhil Schiller revealed it uses the nueral engine to create a new image processing system.\nHe calls it &quot;computational photography mad science.&quot;\nIt uses the neural engine of the A13 Bionic to create a whole new image processing system.\nWhen Apple unveiled the iPhone 11 and its fancy new cameras, it also gave a sneak peek for a brand new camera feature it would offer: Deep Fusion.

However, it appears that <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apples-deep-fusion-camera-feature-now-available-ios-13-developer-beta\">Deep Fusion is rolling out in the latest developer beta</a> of iOS 13.2 on iPhone 11 devices, and will be available to everyone with an iPhone 11 soon.</p>\n<p>While Deep Fusion happens automatically and won't be noticeable like Night Mode, it turns out that it won't be enabled if you have the <strong>Capture Outside of Frame</strong> setting turned on (here's <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-use-camera-iphone-11-and-iphone-11-pro#outside-frame\">how to enable Capture Outside of Frame</a> if you missed it). So if you have Capture Outside of Frame turned on, Deep Fusion will not be available, and vice versa.</p>\n<h2>What is Deep Fusion and how will it work?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/youll-need-disable-capture-outside-frame-use-deep-fusion-iphone-11\" title=\"You'll need to disable Capture Outside of Frame to use Deep Fusion on iPhone 11\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphone-11-deep-fusion.jpg?itok=puMFPYhf\"></a></p>\n<p>Deep Fusion is a new computational photography process specifically on the iPhone 11 line because of the A13 chip. It blends together multiple exposures at the pixel level in order to create a photograph with an even higher level of detail than standard HDR. This means even more detailed textures in things like skin, clothing, and foliage.</p>\n<p>Unlike Night Mode, Deep Fusion will happen automatically and we won't even notice it. However, it will only activate in certain situations.</p>\n<p>With the Wide (Normal) lens, Deep Fusion kicks in at just above the 10 lux floor that triggers Night Mode. Whether Night Mode or Deep Fusion activates depends on the lighting source for the current scene. On the Telephoto camera, Deep Fusion will be active in pretty much everything except the brightest situations, as that is when the Smart HDR goes into effect due to the abundance of highlights.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Deep Fusion has the camera shoot a short frame at a negative EV value. This results in a darker image than you would normally like, but it just pulls sharpness from this frame. It also shoots three regular EV0 images and then a long EV+ frame, aligns everything together, and blends all of the images into one.</p>\n<p>You end up with two 12MP images that are combined together in a single 24MP photo. The process to do this uses four separate neural networks, which account for all of the noise characteristics of the camera sensors, as well as the photo subject matter.</p>\n<p>The machine learning process looks at every individual pixel before combining, and it only takes about one second to process everything. Deep Fusion will happen in the background, and you'll never really notice it until you see the images it produces.</p>\n<h2>What is Capture Outside of Frame?</h2>\n<p>Capture Outside of Frame is a setting available on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro that lets you capture content outside of the frame on the viewfinder. This captured content only appears when you make edits to the photo, such as cropping, straightening, rotating, and adjusting perspective. For QuickTake video capture, it helps improve the composition.</p>\n<h2>So why won't Deep Fusion work with Capture Outside of Frame?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/youll-need-disable-capture-outside-frame-use-deep-fusion-iphone-11\" title=\"You'll need to disable Capture Outside of Frame to use Deep Fusion on iPhone 11\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/deep-fusion-sample-2.jpeg?itok=mqP7yfcE\"></a></p>\n<p>The Capture Outside of Frame feature works by utilizing the Ultra Wide camera to capture the rest of the scene outside of the frame. However, Deep Fusion does not work with the Ultra Wide camera due to the lack of focus pixels and optical image stabilization (this is also why Night Mode does not work with the Ultra Wide lens).</p>\n<p>So if you want to compare how effective Deep Fusion is, take a picture with Deep Fusion on, and then turn on Capture Outside of Frame and take the same photo.</p>\n<h2>Are you looking forward to Deep Fusion?</h2>\n<p>We are definitely excited that Deep Fusion is finally starting to roll out, and we eagerly anticipate the final release hopefully soon. Are you looking forward to Deep Fusion or have any questions about it?

Because of that, Deep Fusion is <em>not</em> compatible with “Photos Capture Outside the Frame”, because the outside-the-frame content is usually captured with the ultra-wide lens. So I think we now have two reasons why “Photos Capture Outside the Frame” is not turned on by default:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Apple believes that Deep Fusion will improve more photos for more users than Capture Outside the Frame will, so Capture Outside the Frame is off by default. Deep Fusion is not a mode or even an option like Night Mode is — it will simply apply automatically when the Camera app thinks it should. For the wide angle lens, that’s in mid-range indoor lighting conditions; for the telephoto, Deep Fusion will be applied in all but the brightest outdoor conditions. (So, if you want to compare the effect of Deep Fusion, one way to do it is to capture the same scene with and without “Photos Capture Outside the Frame” enabled — only when it’s disabled will Deep Fusion kick in.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Privacy. Someone framing a still photo might have something outside the frame they would not want captured — anything from a shirtless portrait where the ultra-wide image would reveal the subject is pantsless as well, to an object on your desk or countertop where the ultra-wide image might reveal an envelope with your home address.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Deep Fusion Coming to iPhones 11 in iOS 13.2 Beta 1’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/01/deep-fusion-ios-13-2-beta-1\"> ★ </a>\n</div>"},"unread":true,"categories":[{"id":"user/f2f031bd-f3e3-4893-a447-467a291c6d1e/category/66132046-6f14-488d-b590-8e93422723c8","label":"Uncategorized"}]},{"originId":"https://www.raywenderlich.com/2942532-concurrency-by-tutorials","fingerprint":"33b56b05","id":"RFlzskW4NhJjlZfijOSI8IXqM9+zz6V9qnDVl1gxaJs=_16d88ed77ca:510a4:18991ffa","updated":1569958464000,"summary":{"direction":"ltr","content":"The book that teaches you everything there is to know about how to write performant and concurrent code for your apps."},"alternate":[{"href":"https://www.raywenderlich.com/2942532-concurrency-by-tutorials","type":"text/html"}],"crawled":1569960327114,"title":"Concurrency by Tutorials [SUBSCRIBER]","published":1569958464000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://www.raywenderlich.com/feed","htmlUrl":"http://www.raywenderlich.com/feed","title":"Ray Wenderlich | High quality programming tutorials: iOS, Android, Swift, Kotlin, Unity, and more"},"unread":true,"categories":[{"id":"user/f2f031bd-f3e3-4893-a447-467a291c6d1e/category/885f2e01-d314-4e63-abac-17dcb063f5b5","label":"Programming"}]},{"originId":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/10/01/zine-revenue-2019/","recrawled":1569966713792,"updateCount":1,"fingerprint":"d93396c7","id":"wEPPtpyxm18xeuKJtd0RXOmRfdiYTcxSNO1zsjNlPdg=_16d88e0db64:5104a:18991ffa","updated":1569934438000,"alternate":[{"href":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/10/01/zine-revenue-2019/","type":"text/html"}],"crawled":1569959500644,"title":"Zine revenue for 2019","published":1569934438000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://jvns.ca/atom.xml","htmlUrl":"http://jvns.ca","title":"Julia Evans"},"content":{"direction":"ltr","content":"<p>I occasionally get questions like “Can you share what you’ve learned about\nrunning a business?” The most surprising thing I’ve learned is that it’s\npossible to make money by teaching people computer things on the internet, so I\nwant to make that a little more concrete by sharing the revenue from the <a href=\"https://wizardzines.com\">zine\nbusiness</a> so far in 2019. Here’s a graph of revenue by\nmonth (the last month is September 2019):</p>\n<p><img width=\"500px\" src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/revenue-by-month.png\"></p>\n<p>This adds up to $87,858 USD for 2019 so far, which (depending on what I release in the\nrest of this year) is on track to be similar to revenue for 2018 ($101,558).</p>\n<p>Until quite recently I’d been writing zines in my spare time, and now I’m <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/09/13/a-year-explaining-computer-things/\">taking a year to focus on it</a>.</p>\n<h3>how $30,000 for September breaks down</h3>\n<p>The most obvious thing in that monthly revenue graph above is that 2 months\n(September and March) have way more revenue than all the others. This is\nbecause I released new zines (Bite Size Networking and HTTP: Learn your browser’s\nlanguage) in those months.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the $30,000 for September breaks down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it’s 85% sales to individuals, 15% <a href=\"https://wizardzines.com/zines-team/\">corporate licenses</a></li>\n<li>it’s approximately:\n<ul>\n<li>$18,000 the new HTTP zine</li>\n<li>$10,000 the various zine packs (the 6 pack and the 3 pack)</li>\n<li>$2,000 other individual zines</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This September was the month with the most sales ever, which is mostly because\nof individual humans who find the zines useful (thank you!!).</p>\n<h3>expenses</h3>\n<p>The main expenses are paying illustrators and an accountant, a mailing list,\nand various books I buy to learn how to do things better. They probably come\nout to about 10% of revenue or so, and then there are taxes after that.</p>\n<h3>giving away free copies has been great</h3>\n<p>With the HTTP zine, like many of my previous zines, I’ve been giving away one\nfree copy for every copy that people buy, so that people can get it even if $12\nis hard for them to afford. (if you can’t afford $12, <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/http-zine/buy-one-give-one\">here’s the\nlink</a>, there are about 70\navailable as I’m writing this). I’m pretty happy with this setup – we’ve given\naway 1358 copies so far. (I think of this as kind of a “sales” statistic too)</p>\n<p>I think I want to automate the system to give away free copies a bit more soon\n(like by automatically updating the number of free zines available using the\nGumroad API instead of periodically doing it manually).</p>\n<h3>hopefully this is a useful data point!</h3>\n<p>Writing about money on the internet is weird, so this will probably be the\nfirst and last zine revenue post, but I’m writing it down in the hopes that\nit’s a useful data point for others. I thought for a long time that you could\nonly really make money from writing on the internet with ads or sponsorships,\nbut it’s not true!</p>\n<p>The goal of this isn’t to say “you should run a business” or anything, just\nthat this is a thing that’s possible in the world and that many developers\ndo really value good educational materials and are happy to pay for them (if\nyou’re one of those people, thank you!)</p>"},"visual":{"url":"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/10/irlbanner-1382819058.jpg","width":620,"height":194,"contentType":"image/jpeg"},"unread":true,"categories":[{"id":"user/f2f031bd-f3e3-4893-a447-467a291c6d1e/category/66132046-6f14-488d-b590-8e93422723c8","label":"Uncategorized"}]},{"originId":"tag:daringfireball.net,2019:/linked//6.36094","recrawled":1569980785874,"updateCount":2,"fingerprint":"157cfb14","id":"ZTHt7g74IlVC5A2IgEvcn/aop5teo99gzFaGU2TCGxs=_16d88da4abd:50ff8:18991ffa","updated":1569979305000,"author":"John Gruber","alternate":[{"href":"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/apple-launches-deep-fusion-feature-in-beta-on-iphone-11-and-iphone-11-pro/","type":"text/html"}],"crawled":1569959070397,"title":"Deep Fusion Coming to iPhones 11 in iOS 13.2 Beta 1","published":1569957535000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://daringfireball.net/index.xml","htmlUrl":"https://daringfireball.net/","title":"Daring Fireball"},"content":{"direction":"ltr","content":"<p>Matthew Panzarino, writing at TechCrunch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple is launching an early look at its new Deep Fusion feature on\niOS <del>today</del> soon with a software update for beta\nusers.

So I think we now have two reasons why “Photos Capture Outside the Frame” is not turned on by default:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Apple believes that Deep Fusion will improve more photos for more users than Capture Outside the Frame will, so Capture Outside the Frame is off by default. Deep Fusion is not a mode or even an option like Night Mode is — it will simply apply automatically when the Camera app thinks it should. For the wide angle lens, that’s in mid-range indoor lighting conditions; for the telephoto, Deep Fusion will be applied in all but the brightest outdoor conditions. (So, if you want to compare the effect of Deep Fusion, one way to do it is to capture the same scene with and without “Photos Capture Outside the Frame” enabled — only when it’s disabled will Deep Fusion kick in.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Privacy. Someone framing a still photo might have something outside the frame they would not want captured — anything from a shirtless portrait where the ultra-wide image would reveal the subject is pantsless as well, to an object on your desk or countertop where the ultra-wide image might reveal an envelope with your home address.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to ‘Deep Fusion Coming to iPhones 11 in iOS 13.2 Beta 1’\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/01/deep-fusion-ios-13-2-beta-1\"> ★ </a>\n</div>"},"visual":{"url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YVzEWS7-wyeXrsbzBSknIPl0cOM=/215x0:2333x1412/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59630315/Screen_Shot_2018_05_04_at_10.28.16_AM.0.png","width":1310,"height":873,"contentType":"image/jpeg"},"unread":true,"categories":[{"id":"user/f2f031bd-f3e3-4893-a447-467a291c6d1e/category/66132046-6f14-488d-b590-8e93422723c8","label":"Uncategorized"}]},{"originId":"tag:daringfireball.net,2019:/linked//6.36093","fingerprint":"f7a11c87","id":"ZTHt7g74IlVC5A2IgEvcn/aop5teo99gzFaGU2TCGxs=_16d88da4abd:50ff7:18991ffa","updated":1569956119000,"author":"John Gruber","alternate":[{"href":"https://medium.com/@adamsandwich/were-sandwich-now-8b6895c5608c","type":"text/html"}],"crawled":1569959070397,"title":"Sandwich","published":1569955917000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://daringfireball.net/index.xml","htmlUrl":"https://daringfireball.net/","title":"Daring Fireball"},"content":{"direction":"ltr","content":"<p>Adam Lisagor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We used to be Sandwich Video.
