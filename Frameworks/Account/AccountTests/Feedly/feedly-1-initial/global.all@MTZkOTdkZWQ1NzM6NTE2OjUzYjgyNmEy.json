That tweet came on the heels of several others from the past few days, centered on a corrupted file from the computer of Professor Willow.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Could these files be left over from Team GO Rocket's recent take-over? <a href=\"https://t.co/6iHQbX7X69\">pic.twitter.com/6iHQbX7X69</a></p>\u2014 Pok\u00e9mon GO (@PokemonGoApp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1178699574313017344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>So far, Niantic hasn't revealed the details of what these tweets might mean. Speculation among the Pok\u00e9mon Go community is that players will be able to face off against higher ranking \u2014 and thus more powerful \u2014 characters from Team Go Rocket in an upcoming update. They could be coming to research tasks, raids, or just taking over location on the map like their grunts. But with Halloween right around the corner, it's the perfect time for new Shadow Pok\u00e9mon to be unleashed in-game.</p>\n<p>There's also a chance that Rotom, a mercurial Pok\u00e9mon who's been known to take over electronics, might be part of all this. It's already been monkeying with the Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield website, so Rotom may be the culprit behind Professor Willow's corrupted file too.</p>\n<p>In any case, we'll be keeping a close eye on both the Twitter account and Pok\u00e9mon Go itself to give you the lowdown on whatever dirty deeds Team Go Rocket has planned next.</p>\n<p></p><p></p>\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go\">Pokemon Go</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go\"><img alt=\"Pok\u00e9mon Go Resources\" width=\"600\" src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/field/image/2017/06/pokemon-go-raid-tyranitar-wallpaper.jpg\" height=\"338\"></a></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go-events\">Pok\u00e9mon Go Events</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go-alolan-forms\">Pok\u00e9mon Go Alolan Forms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go-shiny\">Pok\u00e9mon Go Shiny Forms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go-legendary-raids\">Pok\u00e9mon Go Legendaries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-pokemon-go-cheats\">Pok\u00e9mon Go Best Cheats</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go-tips-tricks\">Pok\u00e9mon Go Tips and Tricks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-pokemon-go-move-sets-attack-defense\">Pok\u00e9mon Go Best Movesets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-catch-ditto-pokemon-go\">How to find and catch Ditto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go-unown\">How to find and catch Unown</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p></p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/ON22UQ7y08c\" height=\"1\">",

In macOS Catalina, the company has taken this to all-new levels by introducing beneficial security changes that make it even harder for miscreants to play havoc with our computers. However, because security is a tricky business, so-called improvements for some might not work for others. Specifically, Apple's decision to make Gatekeeper even more difficult crack is a significant step forward for everyday Mac users. For developers, perhaps not so much. Luckily, there's a workaround.</p>\n<h2>What is Gatekeeper?</h2>\n<p>Gatekeeper has been an essential part of macOS for years. As its name suggests, the tool has been designed to check recently downloaded apps for known malware and sends it to quarantine. In his June article, <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/great-mac-balancing-act-catalina-security-explained\">The Great Mac Balancing Act</a>, Rene Ritchie explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Currently, when you download an app, whether it's off the Store or the Web or even from AirDrop, that app is quarantined. If and when you try to open a quarantined app, Gatekeeper checks it for known malware, validates the developer signature to make sure it hasn't been tampered with, makes sure it's allowed to run, for example matches your settings for App Store apps and/or known developer apps, and then double checks with you that you really want to run the app for the first time, that it's not trying to pull a fast one and autorun itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Until now, Gatekeeper didn't take the same approach with apps launched via Terminal. It also didn't check non-quarantined apps and files for malware. In other words, it checked an app only once for malware.</p>\n<p>Significant changes have arrived with macOS Catalina.</p>\n<p>Now, apps started through Terminal are also checked. These files get the same malware scan, signature check, and local security policy check. The difference: even on the first run, you only need to explicitly approve software launched in bundles\ufffc, like a standard Mac app bundle, not for standalone executables or libraries.</p>\n<p>With macOS Catalina, perhaps more significantly, Gatekeeper will also check non-quarantined apps and files for problems. Not just once or twice, but <em>every time</em> you run it. When your Mac detects a problem, it blocks the file, then sends you an alert.</p>\n<p>If all this sounds fantastic to you, terrific. That's undoubtedly Apple's intent. However, some developers might view this differently and find the changes cumbersome, at best.</p>\n<h2>A Workaround</h2>\n<p>Even though Gatekeeper in macOS is now stricter than ever, there is a way around it -- including macOS Catalina's newest tools. The workaround makes it possible to download and use apps downloaded from anywhere on macOS Catalina and earlier versions without a check.</p>\n<p>First published in 2016 by <a href=\"http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/27/allow-apps-from-anywhere-macos-gatekeeper/\">OSX Daily</a>, but still valid, the &quot;fix&quot; works like this:</p>\n<ol><li>Be sure to exit <strong>System Preferences</strong> on your Mac. </li>\n<li>On Finder, click <strong>Go</strong>. </li>\n<li>Select <strong>Utilities</strong>.</li>\n<li><p>Double-click <strong>Terminal</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-anywhere-macos-catalina-and-mojave\" title=\"How to open apps from unidentified developers on Mac in macOS Catalina\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/macos-catalina-terminal.jpg?itok=AEMRbgFy\"></a></p></li>\n<li>Type of the following command syntax: <code>sudo spctl --master-disable</code> .</li>\n<li>Hit <strong>Return</strong> </li>\n<li>Authenticate with an <strong>admin password</strong>.</li>\n<li>Hit <strong>Return</strong>.</li>\n<li>Exit Terminal. </li>\n</ol><h3>Changing your settings</h3>\n<p>Now, it's time to allow your Mac to open any app.</p>\n<ol><li>Click on <strong>System Preferences</strong> on your Mac Dock. </li>\n<li>Choose <strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong>.</li>\n<li><p>Tap the <strong>lock</strong> at the bottom left of the screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-anywhere-macos-catalina-and-mojave\" title=\"How to open apps from unidentified developers on Mac in macOS Catalina\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/macos-catalina-unlock-security.jpg?itok=7JsD1nQi\"></a></p></li>\n<li>Enter your <strong>password</strong> to unlock Security and Privacy. </li>\n<li>Choose the <strong>Anywhere</strong> under Allow apps downloaded from.

In order to play online, you <strong>must have a Nintendo Switch Online membership</strong> as well as a Nintendo Account.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-3.jpg?itok=pIMvIh16\"></a></p>\n<p>From what we can tell, it looks like trainers will be able to wander the Wild Area section of the map together. When they converge on a raid beam, a raid battle begins. But unlike previous Pok\u00e9mon encounters these are wild Dynamaxing Pok\u00e9mon, which means they are huge and are far more powerful than usual.</p>\n<p>In Sword and Shield, trainers also have the ability to use Dynamax on one Pok\u00e9mon during a battle. This make your monster larger and more powerful for three turns. However, in Max Raid Battles, only one of the four of you will be able to Dynamax their Pok\u00e9mon. You'll need to strategically plan with your friends in order to take down your wild opponent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-dynamax-ball.jpg?itok=nuaNImTT\"></a></p>\n<p>Once you've sufficiently weakened the wild raid Pok\u00e9mon, you'll have the chance to catch it using a massive Dynamax Pok\u00e9 Ball. As of right now, we don't know where you get these Large Pok\u00e9 Balls in the game or how many you can hold at once, but we'll update when we learn more.</p>\n<h2>What Pok\u00e9mon can you battle in Max Raid Battles?</h2>\n<p>Your location on the map and the current in-game weather determine the type of Pok\u00e9mon you encounter in raids. <strong>Some Pok\u00e9mon can only be caught after you defeat them in a Max Raid Battle</strong>, so you'll need to go raiding if you want to complete your Pok\u00e9dex. We're not sure if legendary Pok\u00e9mon from previous games will appear in Max Raid Battles, but it looks like just about any regular Pok\u00e9mon featured in Sword and Shield should show up in raids.</p>\n<h3>Will Max Raid Battles be hard to win?</h3>\n<p>Since we haven't been able to experience a Max Raid Battle ourselves it's hard to tell how difficult of a challenge these battles will be. However, Sword and Shield's planning director, Kazumasa Iwao, has stated that some of them won't be a walk in the park.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I think some of them are going to be pretty difficult. I think it's going to have a kind of difficulty we haven't seen in a lot of main series Pok\u00e9mon games up until now, but there is a wide spread of difficulties even in the Max Raid Battles. It starts out a little easier, then you can choose the difficulty based on how powerful your Pok\u00e9mon are. Even for me, a seasoned Pok\u00e9mon player, even if I go with one of the five-star Max Raid Battles, I can definitely run into situations where I'm not able to win.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fortunately, players will be able to see how difficult a Raid Battle will be before entering and can choose whether or not to engage. That will help players find challenges that they can tackle or give them something to work up to.</p>\n<h2>How many Max Raid Battles can you do each day?</h2>\n<p>We currently don't know if there is a cap for the number of raids you can engage in throughout the day. It might be like Pok\u00e9mon GO where you can take part in one free raid per day but must pay for additional raid passes. We'll update this section when we learn more.</p>\n<h2>Image Gallery</h2>\n<p>Here are addition pictures of Max Raid Battles:</p>\n<div><div>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-dynamax2.jpg?itok=KosofOPc\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-dynamax2.jpg?itok=KosofOPc\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-5.jpg?itok=32d4Qsc8\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-5.jpg?itok=32d4Qsc8\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-11.jpg?itok=1JmYxidb\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-11.jpg?itok=1JmYxidb\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-6.jpg?itok=1o_vJFRD\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-6.jpg?itok=1o_vJFRD\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-10.jpg?itok=ciiRuxDF\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-10.jpg?itok=ciiRuxDF\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-9.jpg?itok=iL22ZaED\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-9.jpg?itok=iL22ZaED\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-8.jpg?itok=kHqt4Xhe\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-8.jpg?itok=kHqt4Xhe\"></a></div> </div>\n\n<h2>Canine steel</h2>\n<h3>Pok\u00e9mon Sword</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-are-max-raid-battles-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"What are Max Raid Battles in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-game.jpg?itok=XLHO7epP\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-Sword-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07PC7X38X?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU53611YYr\" title=\"\">$60 pre-order at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>Encounter Zacian and explore a new region</p>\n<p>Wander the Galar region as you complete your Pok\u00e9dex and encounter new characters.

He even won a BAFTA award for the game CyberPNK when he was just 12.

And like Wizarding World in Universal Studios, the new Galaxy's Edge space in both Disneyland and Disneyworld is truly a way to feel like you're actually in this fantastic wold. But if you're going to make the trip out to Batuu, you need to look the part. And while it's relatively easy to find a themed shirt or good cosplay to have some fun with, but what about your phone? Disney makes this incredible Galaxy's Edge app for interacting with all the different characters and activities while visiting Batuu, but your phone kind of stands out as not a part of that universe, right?</p>\n<p>It turns out there's a talented group of people out there who have made a fantastic solution to this.

Once you're happy with the look, you paint it and then apply a clear coat, so the paint stays. Because of this, you need to keep a couple of things in mind:</p>\n<ul><li>This case is going to be somewhat fragile and probably not your daily case. Use it for special occasions to show off, that's about it. </li>\n<li>Every Datapad case is unique! Use what you have around you and make it your own.</li>\n<li>There is no such thing as being &quot;not crafty enough&quot; for this kind of thing. Feel free to explore and make it your own. </li>\n</ul><h3>Preparing your case</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-make-galaxys-edge-datapad-case-your-iphone-11-pro\" title=\"How to make a Galaxy's Edge Datapad case for your iPhone 11 Pro\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/galaxys-edge-case-clear.jpg?itok=miEMZHC8\"></a></p>\n<p>Start with a super basic case, something you know you can easily slip on and off your phone. I recommend the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Ultra-Hybrid-Designed-iPhone/dp/B07T3PTHKG?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58219YYr\" title=\"\">Spigen Ultra Hybrid Crystal Clear Case for iPhone 11</a> because it's flexible and grips the phone well. And because I have a dark green iPhone 11 Pro, the three-camera array already looks like something out of science fiction. But whatever case you choose, make sure it's something you can put your phone in without a lot of force or multiple steps.</p>\n<p>You need to figure out what bits you want to add to your case. The one designed by Kevin Myers in these photos comes mostly from leftover Games Workshop bits, but you really can use anything. Collect a handful of pieces and organize them on your case until you have a design with which you're happy.</p>\n<p>This detailing can include tubing around the outside, knobs made from low profile beverage caps, LEDs that blink (don't add these until the last step, obviously), whatever makes you happiest. The goal here is to find a design that works for you, and once you have it, you need to glue it all down. Don't use regular old Elmer's glue either; you need something that will keep these pieces in place, and probably use more than you usually would for something like this. Hot glue or super glue tends to work best for this kind of project.</p>\n<p>Give your case plenty of time to dry once you've glued it all down, and then inspect it to see how it feels in your hand.</p>\n<h3>Paints and polishes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-make-galaxys-edge-datapad-case-your-iphone-11-pro\" title=\"How to make a Galaxy's Edge Datapad case for your iPhone 11 Pro\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/galaxys-edge-case-paint.jpg?itok=-Cgh8z5y\"></a></p>\n<p>The next step here is almost like painting a miniature, which, if you've never done, can be a little intimidating. But really, it's all about layers. You start with a primer layer, so everything is the same standard color, and all of the surfaces of this case can receive paint in the same way.</p>\n<p>If you choose a grey primer, you've got a good base layer with a great metallic color. But if you're not sure how the paint will stick to the case, use a black primer and make a metallic layer of paint on top as you see in this design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-make-galaxys-edge-datapad-case-your-iphone-11-pro\" title=\"How to make a Galaxy's Edge Datapad case for your iPhone 11 Pro\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/galaxys-edge-case-primer.jpg?itok=oQiPlcCk\"></a></p>\n<p>Since this is Star Wars, you need to mess that metallic layer up a little. Make the case look worn, like it's a relic only barely functioning. You can accomplish this with weathering techniques using paint, some darker washes with watery paint that dries unevenly, or just scuff up your design a little and make it look less polished. Have some fun with it, make this thing look like it's been beaten up.</p>\n<p>With your weathering layer dry, you can add colors and character. With the darker, grittier greys and blacks in the background, take advantage of the brighter colors in your palette for the highlights. Make the corners and accents of your case stand out a little.</p>\n<h3>Finish and selfie</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-make-galaxys-edge-datapad-case-your-iphone-11-pro\" title=\"How to make a Galaxy's Edge Datapad case for your iPhone 11 Pro\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/galaxys-edge-case-hero.jpg?itok=-QGpR0Gv\"></a></p>\n<p>Once everything has dried, you need to protect your creation! A final varnish coat will add a small layer of material that preserves the whole creation without adding a lot of extra thickness. It's essential not to use a high gloss finishing coat, because you just spent all that time making this thing look weathered! A matte finish will give it a nice clear coat and not stand out too much.</p>\n<p>This varnish coat will take a while to dry, and you want it to be completely dry before you pick it up. Once you have, test carefully putting your phone in the case and removing it to make sure nothing disconnects or comes loose. If it does, you want to get some additional glue in place and make sure it all stays together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-make-galaxys-edge-datapad-case-your-iphone-11-pro\" title=\"How to make a Galaxy's Edge Datapad case for your iPhone 11 Pro\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/galaxys-edge-case-russell.jpg?itok=D5HkvU5R\"></a></p>\n<p>Now you're done!

These characters are part of a trading quest that spans the entire game, and while not necessary, is nonetheless recommended to do before you beat the game. Essentially, you start with one item and then trade it to a character for another, which you then exchange for another, and so forth until you have items that are useful to you.</p>\n<h2>How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/links-awakening-nintendo-switch-trade-04.jpg?itok=OB3T8HUa\"></a></p>\n<p>You'll be working on this quest as you make your way through multiple dungeons, and won't be done until the very end of the game. But don't worry! Despite being a bit winding and long, the trading quest is very easy to finish, with a cool reward at the end. Here's how to do it!</p>\n<ol><li><p>Play the Trendy Game in Mabe Village and win the <strong>Yoshi Doll.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/links-awakening-trading-12.jpg?itok=w85-8zXf\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p>Give the Yoshi Doll to Mamasha in the big house (with all the beds) in Mabe Village to receive a <strong>Ribbon.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/links-awakening-trading-14.jpg?itok=woblVqsW\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p>In Mabe Village, visit the house with the Chain Chomp outside and give the Ribbon to the small Chain Chomp inside the right-hand building.

You'll reach a dead-end near the castle that's guarded by a monkey named Kiki. Give them the Bananas for a bridge that will let you progress, as well as a <strong>Stick.</strong></li>\n<li><p>The Stick is for Tarin, who you'll find near the Warp Point in Ukuku Prairie (close to the village) trying to shake down a beehive. Reluctantly hand it over for him to poke the next, and when he's gone pick up the <strong>HoneyComb.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/links-awakening-nintendo-switch-trade-05.jpg?itok=c8ZgYb7c\"></a></p></li>\n<li>When you reach Animal Village, a bear chef in one of the houses will accept your Honeycomb and give you a <strong>Pineapple</strong> in return.</li>\n<li><p>Once you can dash, swim, and lift boulders, Tal Tal Heights will open up to you, and you can find Papahl, who's very hungry. Offer him the Pineapple for a <strong>Hibiscus.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/links-awakening-trading-16.jpg?itok=S7BuckEn\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p>Head back to Animal Village with the Hibiscus and give it to Christine, a goat in one of the houses, in exchange for a <strong>Letter.</strong> (Return once you've delivered it for a Seashell!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/links-awakening-trading-17.jpg?itok=b8scVNZV\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p>The Letter is addressed to Mr. Wright, who you met earlier in the game north of forest and just west of the swamp.

Leaving the bridge, swim to the north into an open area of water and speak to the Mermaid, who wants her Necklace back and will give you a <strong>Scale</strong> for it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/links-awakening-nintendo-switch-trade-07.jpg?itok=yl66or-5\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, once you've finished the fifth dungeon and have the Hookshot, you can cross a large gap in Martha's Bay and reach the Mermaid Statue. Place the Scale on the statue, which will open a cave that holds the <strong>Magnifying Lens</strong>. Be careful! There are hidden enemies in the room. Just keep going and try to avoid them until you get the item.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/links-awakening-nintendo-switch-trade-12.jpg?itok=EfdK67HA\"></a></p></li>\n<li>The <strong>Magnifying Lens</strong> can then be used to read the book in the bottom right of the library in Mabe Village, which will instruct you on how to finish the game's final dungeon.</li>\n</ol><p>The trading sequence is easy enough to do, though it's not technically required past giving the Bananas to the Monkeys to cross the bridge to the castle. The Magnifying Lens gives you directions through the final dungeon, but if you look online or know the instructions already from playing the game before, you don't need to rely on it. However, getting the Magnifying Lens does allow you to get the Boomerang.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the Boomerang?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/links-awakening-nintendo-switch-trade-11.jpg?itok=xlXfnI-z\"></a></p>\n<p>The Magnifying Glass lets you see hidden things, and it just so happens that there's a hidden NPC that gives the Boomerang only to those who can see him. He's located on Toronbo Shoes. From Sale's house, drop down to the lowest level (near the waterline) and head slightly east until you see a cracked wall. Bomb it, and you'll enter a cave where an NPC named Goriya will trade you the Boomerang in exchange for another item you have on your person. Give him something you don't need, like the Shovel, and enjoy your new Boomerang.</p>\n<h2>Are these items required?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/links-awakening-nintendo-switch-trade-08.jpg?itok=K-Q2XOGf\"></a></p>\n<p>No, you don't need the Boomerang to do anything in Link's Awakening, though it is beneficial to be able to hit or stun enemies from a distance without wasting arrows. And, though it does reveal an invisible NPC in a house in Animal Village (the empty home in the corner where you hear a weird noise when you walk in) the magnifying glass is not necessary either. The hidden animal simply tells you where to find Goriya...and gives you a Seashell for your trouble!</p>\n<h2>Our top equipment picks</h2>\n<p>Everything you need to set out on your adventure on Koholint Island.</p>\n<h3>Get the game</h3>\n<h4>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-trading-quest-links-awakening\" title=\"How to complete the trading quest in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/08/links-awakening-render.jpg?itok=C4CymoLf\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Links-Awakening-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07SG15148?th=1&tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57963YYr\" title=\"\">$60 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>Awake the wind fish</p>\n<p>Link finds himself stranded on a strange island that exists in the shadow of a massive egg.

But over the years, I drifted away from <a href=\"http://www.postbox-inc.com\">Postbox, Inc.</a>'s eponymous pride and joy, and every other dedicated email app, in favor of just checking Gmail on the web. I spent so much time in my browser anyway that firing up another app to check or send messages seemed pointlessly time-consuming. Yet the brand new Postbox 7 has succeeded in turning my head.</p>\n<p>The last version I tried layered impressive features atop the increasingly creaky underpinnings of Mozilla Thunderbird; Postbox 7, while still based on Mozilla code, has a far sturdier \u2013 and faster \u2013 foundation. The previous version looked stodgy, square, and gray; the new one blooms with 20 eye-pleasing themes. Add that to a frankly ridiculous level of useful abilities, and you've got an app that makes a solid case for keeping one less tab open in your browser.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.postbox-inc.com\" title=\"\">$30 per year - Download now</a></p>\n<h2>The email client you never knew you wanted</h2>\n<p>Postbox is best described as &quot;Apple Mail but with <em>literally every feature you ever wished Apple Mail had</em>, plus some other features, plus more features on top of those.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sure, it does all the usual email-y things, quickly and well and in a nice-looking interface. It supports both IMAP and the increasingly rare, old-school POP mail. Colorful, well-labeled icons prevent confusion, message and thread headers come with handy previews and message counts to track data, and messages with inline photos and other formatting display beautifully. The aforementioned themes offer a lovely mix of colors and styles, both in light and dark mode, to suit any preference and personality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/postbox-7-review-elite-email-excellence\" title=\"Postbox 7 review: Elite email excellence\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/postbox7_themes_0.jpg?itok=trAgLj0u\"></a></p>\n<p>Setup's a snap, too, whether you're starting fresh or importing settings from a previous version. I dreaded having to slog over to Gmail and create yet another app password, but nope! Postbox not only configured all its settings correctly based solely on my email address but also helpfully opened a window to Gmail to walk me through its end of the setup process automatically. And once that was finished, a flotilla of useful, coherent tutorial videos popped up for my edification.</p>\n<p>The programmers' promise that Postbox 7 is three times as fast as its predecessor holds up, too. On an aging laptop or a modern iMac, the app felt fast and responsive \u2013 at least once it finished indexing all 2,000 of my downloaded messages. That process was understandably poky, but not agonizingly so. As with previous versions, Postbox's help files proved clear, concise, and easy to follow \u2013\u00a0which is good, because as you'll soon see, you'll probably want to consult them more than once.</p>\n<p>In short, you can rest assured that Postbox 7 covers the basics well. But the more you venture off the beaten path of forwards and replies, the more you begin to see what Postbox can <em>really</em> do.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-clone-id=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Calling all power users</h2>\n<p>Every client will show you messages, of course, and plenty also let you narrow those messages down to just the ones you've flagged as reminders. But Postbox also lets you view your messages by attachments or photos, and each view (once indexed) is fully searchable. You don't need to go trawling through piles of messages in search of that one adorable picture of your nephew when it's right there at your fingertips.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/postbox-7-review-elite-email-excellence\" title=\"Postbox 7 review: Elite email excellence\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/postbox7_attachments.jpg?itok=gyj0YXnv\"></a></p>\n<p>A similar helpful sidebar pops up in the Compose window, putting both attachments and images already in your inbox right at your fingertips, should you wish to send them along to friends. The Compose sidebar also adds a handy address book that instantly pulls in all your macOS Contacts. But if a separate Compose window's just too much to bother with, you can also compose a quick reply to any message right from the main message-viewing window.</p>\n<p>But that's just the start of what Postbox can do. (This is where those aforementioned help files start coming in handy.) If you're juggling multiple accounts, you can set up &quot;domain fencing&quot; to ensure that you never accidentally send a personal email from a work account, or vice versa. Once properly warned, Postbox will flag any addresses that don't seem to match the domain you're sending from. (One would think any number of politicians might clamor for that particular feature.)</p>\n<p>If you find yourself copying and pasting the same form email messages over and over and over, Postbox can save you the hassle. Its built-in responses feature lets you create as many different premade messages as you want, right at your fingertips in the compose window. (You can even name them so that they appear in custom-made nested categories within the Responses menu.) Its Placeholder feature uses simple snippets of code to mark places in those responses where Postbox can either automatically pull in data like the recipient's name or address, or just let you easily hopscotch through the message filling in those blanks yourself. And if you're pressed for time or just a particularly bad speller, Postbox even offers its own extensive library of professionally written responses for your use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/postbox-7-review-elite-email-excellence\" title=\"Postbox 7 review: Elite email excellence\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/postbox7_compose_0.jpg?itok=rl0Q-MZ_\"></a></p>\n<p>But wait, there's more! Postbox 7, not content to offer full HMTL editing of any message, also offers Clips \u2014 easily insertable chunks of custom HTML, including CSS styling, that you can add to any message. You can use its existing library of attractive-looking elements like captioned image blocks, pull quotes, bullets, and more to create beautiful email newsletters with ease or create your own custom clips alongside them.</p>\n<p>And in addition to built-in support for Evernote and several other popular productivity apps, Postbox's Quick Post feature works with services like IFTTT and Zapier, and through them with apps like Trello and Slack, to quickly add service-friendly tags to an email and fire it off to those services for easy integration.</p>\n<p>Postbox 7 has ditched its predecessor's Thunderbird-based add-ons but replaced them with Postbox Labs, a home for experimental (and largely unsupported) extensions and additions to the program's capabilities. At launch, the rather modest selection includes the ability to encrypt your mail through OpenPGP.</p>\n<h2>Before you lunge for your wallet\u2026</h2>\n<p>Obviously, I liked Postbox 7 a lot \u2013 but that doesn't mean it's perfect. I ran into annoying but non-dealbreaker hiccups during my test of the program. One email address, copied from Microsoft Outlook, pasted in strangely, and repeated attempts to edit it couldn't manage to fix it. Another time, a fresh install of the app wouldn't index my messages until I quit the program and reopened it.</p>\n<p>Postbox 7 is also way, way, <em>way</em> more email client than most human beings will ever need. Unless you rely heavily on email in your professional life or really dig all of Postbox's integrations with other productivity tools, you can probably get by with Apple Mail or your web-based mail of choice. That's especially true since Postbox 7 has switched to the dreaded subscription-based app model. If you want to enjoy its considerable splendor, expect to pay $30 every year for the privilege.</p>\n<h2>My verdict</h2>\n<p> </p><div>\n<span>4</span>\n<span>out of 5</span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </div>\n<p>If you live and die by email, that $30 could be money well spent. Postbox runs like a champ, looks like a dream, works like a different and mostly good but very occasionally weird and confusing dream, and has more cool tricks stuffed into it than one of those high-end Swiss Army knives the approximate thickness of a paperback book. You might not need an email client this great, but if you do, you likely won't find a better one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.postbox-inc.com\" title=\"\">$30 per year - Download now</a></p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/vUHhwrfd3Gw\" height=\"1\">",

This is an enhanced adventure that combines the 3D version of the game, previously released on both PS4 and PC, as well as the 16-bit version that was released exclusively in Japan on the 3DS. Many folks are saying that playing Dragon Quest XI on Switch is the best way to enjoy the game, and I heartily agree.</p>\n<p>The cartoony visuals, vibrant landscapes, turn-based combat, and fantasy storyline all feel at home on Switch devices. What's more, the improved music, added character storylines, and gorgeous 2D mode all work together to make this the best version of the game that I've seen yet. Seriously, if you haven't picked this game up for your Switch you really ought to.</p>\n<p>It tells the tale of an unnamed protagonist who discovers early on that he's, not only an orphaned prince but also the Luminary - a magical individual who's responsible for defeating darkness and protecting the land. Unfortunately, some believe that he is the very darkness that he seeks to destroy. You'll be on the lam from your hunters from pretty early on in the game. As you traverse the land you'll battle fantastical monsters, meet new folks to travel with, learn more about who you are, and defeat the evil forces plaguing the land.</p>\n\n<h3>Legendary Luminary</h3>\n<h4>Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/dragon-quest-xi-s-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Dragon Quest XI S for Nintendo Switch review: This is the best version of an already amazing game\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/dragon-quest-xi-s.jpg?itok=lvyC7_qA\"></a></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: This is the best version of Dragon Quest XI. It includes new character storylines, allows you to switch between playing a 2D and 3D version of the game, and has several other small enhancements to make the gaming experience more convenient and fun.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul><li>2D mode is awesome</li>\n<li>Gorgeous world and character design</li>\n<li>New story content adds to character backstories</li>\n<li>Orchestral music is phenomenal</li>\n<li>Fun turn-based combat</li>\n<li>Several small enhancements</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul><li>The world isn't as open as it first appears</li>\n<li>Not for those who hate battle grinding</li>\n</ul><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Quest-XI-Elusive-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B07NQGDXRY?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58011YYr\" title=\"\">$50 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-clone-id=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>An epic turn-based RPG</h4>\n<h2>Dragon Quest XI S <em>What I like</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/dragon-quest-xi-s-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Dragon Quest XI S for Nintendo Switch review: This is the best version of an already amazing game\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/dragon-quest-xi-s-switch-review-025.jpg?itok=WKPi7IXo\"></a></p>\n<h3>Gorgeous visuals <em>Art direction and resolution</em></h3>\n<p>Before this game released, many people, including myself, expressed concern over how the game would look on the Switch considering the lower resolution and frame rate capabilities of the Nintendo gaming system. From the moment I started up the game, I was blown away by how well the visuals and gameplay looked. I mean, you can definitely see a difference if you compare the PS4 version side-by-side against the Switch's, but overall the game runs beautifully and is pure eye candy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The 3D mode and 16-bit mode are different enough from each other to feel like two completely different versions of the game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What's more, if you're playing in handheld mode the low resolution really isn't noticeable thanks to the small dimensions of the screen. The game looks equally beautiful in docked mode while displayed on my large flat-screen TV. Sometimes the lines are a little blurry, but it's really only noticeable if you go looking for it.</p>\n<p>One of the things I love about this game is the gorgeous landscapes and character designs. Everything is full of rich colors whether it be the green countryside or the blue hair of your traveling companion. The monsters you come across all have interesting designs and some of them have clever names to go with them. It makes me excited to go exploring whenever I reach a new area because I'm never sure what new monsters or locations I'll come across.</p>\n<h3>2D and 3D modes <em>Feels like two different games</em></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/dragon-quest-xi-s-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Dragon Quest XI S for Nintendo Switch review: This is the best version of an already amazing game\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/dragon-quest-xi-s-switch-review-039.jpg?itok=PcBB_TKg\"></a></p>\n<p>If you're unfamiliar with the history of Dragon Quest XI then it might be strange to learn that there's a complete 2D version of the game that comes with the Switch release. Back in 2017, a 16-bit version of the game released exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo 3DS. So the 2D version isn't completely new, but a section of it is.</p>\n<p>To tie the 2D sections in with the 3D game, Square Enix added a new 2D location called Tickington. Here players interact with Tockles, little white creatures that were previously unnamed and resemble Adipose from the Doctor Who TV series. Tickington is basically a station for several side quests. I love this section because it forces you to interact with the 2D world and the short quests remind me of playing games on my SNES in the 90s.</p>\n<p>You can play in the 2D world as you go through the game, all you need to do is interact with a church or a statue to switch between the 3D and the gorgeous, retro, 16-bit world. The best part about the two modes is that they are different enough from each other to feel like two completely different versions of the game. For instance, instead of being able to see monsters and avoid them like in 3D the 2D mode operates with random encounters. Additionally, the map looks different and items are placed in different areas compared to where they are in 3D. It's almost like getting double your money's worth since you can enjoy the game for twice as long.</p>\n<h3>New story content <em>Adds depth to teammates</em></h3>\n<p>The storyline in Dragon Quest XI is already good, but the addition of character backstories and cut scenes in the definitive Switch edition, makes it so there's even more to discover. Once you get to a specific section of the game, you are able to play as the other members of your team. This allows you to learn about their pasts and visit new locations from their own perspective instead of witnessing it from the view of the main character. Some of the added content can feel a little disjointed at times, but I love that it allows you to get more out of this story.</p>\n<h3>Fun combat mechanics <em>For those who love turn-based RPGs</em></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/dragon-quest-xi-s-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Dragon Quest XI S for Nintendo Switch review: This is the best version of an already amazing game\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/dragon-quest-xi-s-switch-review-029.jpg?itok=n_eyJpYS\"></a></p>\n<p>I've already mentioned several times that this JRPG has a turn-based battle system. What I like about this one is that it allows you to move around during battles so you aren't stuck in one spot. Combat isn't groundbreaking or anything, but I do find the battles in this game challenging and satisfying.</p>\n<p>I love the feeling I get from RPGs when I become stronger and this game makes you feel like you earn it. There are plenty of new attacks to learn by leveling up or by interacting with the skill trees. As with most RPGs, this one allows you to purchase better equipment and gear to increase your combat stats. However, gear is pretty expensive and you need to do a lot of battling in order to get the necessary amount of funds and experience to defeat bosses. It makes it more rewarding when you do become powerful or when you do earn enough money to purchase the best weapons and armor.</p>\n<h3>The enhancements <em>New music and conveniences</em></h3>\n<p>There are several enhancements in the Switch definitive edition that make playing the game more convenient and fun. Some of them aren't noticeable, but others make a huge difference. For example, in previous versions of the game players could only access the Fun-Size Forge when at a campsite, but the Switch version allows you to craft weapons and gear anywhere as long as you have the materials needed. This is a huge improvement that makes it easier to equip your characters with good gear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The visuals, play style, and enhancements really make the Switch version of Dragon Quest XI the best one out there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the most obvious improvements is with the orchestral music. The minute you start up the Switch game, the lively instruments greet your ears. It's a marked improvement over the synthesized music found in previous versions of the game. If you really want to, you can switch back to the original music to switch things up. Additionally, Switch owners get the option of choosing between the English or Japanese voiceovers.</p>\n<p>Among the small improvements is the addition of the Horse Hailer, which allows you to summon your horse to you even when there is no bell post handy. It goes without saying, that this makes it easier to traverse the map. You can also skip cut scenes if you want to instead of playing through them, there are new marriage options for you to experience, new costumes for your characters to wear, you now gain a small amount of experience when you run monsters over with your horse, and there are plenty of other small changes. You won't notice many of these improvements, but they work together to make a better gaming experience.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-clone-id=\"purch_Y_L_0_1\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Dragon Quest XI S <em>What I don't like</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/dragon-quest-xi-s-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Dragon Quest XI S for Nintendo Switch review: This is the best version of an already amazing game\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/dragon-quest-xi-s-switch-review-037.jpg?itok=jmQDBRRt\"></a></p>\n<p>I still say Dragon Quest XI S on Switch is the best version of this game. However, there are some things that could still use improvement.</p>\n<h3>Too many boundaries <em>The world isn't as open as it first appears</em></h3>\n<p>From the minute I started a brand new game, the visuals and colorful imagery of Dragon Quest XI S delighted me. It's especially awe-inspiring when I finally got to explore the large world for the first time. However, the illusion of freedom gets shattered whenever I come across the many invisible walls that prevent me from entering water or from jumping off certain ledges.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was reminded of how many invisible walls there are while replaying this RPG.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since it's been a while since I last played this game on PS4, I'd forgotten how many limitations there are. It really wouldn't be so bad if the limitations were consistent. However, that's not the case. Some areas allow you to wade in water, while others won't let you touch it at all. Similarly, you might be able to jump off a ledge in one area, but invisible walls prevent you from doing it in another. It really doesn't seem like there's a reason for this and just makes me feel confined.</p>\n<h3>Repetitive combat <em>Too much grinding</em></h3>\n<p>If you haven't played Dragon Quest XI before, it's important to note that you need to do a lot of battle grinding if you want to get far in this game. Gear can be pretty expensive and enemies can be difficult so you'll need to fight a lot of monsters in order to earn experience and money. I personally find it relaxing, but I know there are many people who don't like battling this much.</p>\n<p>The Switch version does allow you to increase battle speed to ultra-fast so you don't have to spend as much time watching battle animations, but it can still take time to get through multiple fights. If this doesn't sound fun to you, then Dragon Quest XI might not be a game you'd enjoy.</p>\n<h2>Dragon Quest XI S <em>Bottom Line</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/dragon-quest-xi-s-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Dragon Quest XI S for Nintendo Switch review: This is the best version of an already amazing game\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/dragon-quest-xi-s-switch-review-009.jpg?itok=rkZxY76s\"></a></p>\n<p>Dragon Quest XI was already an amazing game, but when you play the Nintendo Switch version the additional enhancements further improve the experience. Though the visuals don't look as good as they do on PC or PS4, the art style and colors look great on the Switch whether you're playing in handheld or docked mode. The landscapes are gorgeous, the characters all have vibrant and interesting personalities, there are plenty of interesting monsters to battle, and I find combat deeply rewarding. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs and fantasy adventures.</p>\n<p> </p><div>\n<span>4.5</span>\n<span>out of 5</span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </div>\n<p>This fantasy adventure lets you experience an epic journey. It's got an interesting plot, good battle mechanics, and gorgeous visuals. Anyone itching for a good RPG will enjoy this game in either the retro 16-bit mode or the HD 3D mode.</p>\n\n<h3>Legendary Luminary</h3>\n<h4>Dragon Quest XI S</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/dragon-quest-xi-s-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Dragon Quest XI S for Nintendo Switch review: This is the best version of an already amazing game\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/dragon-quest-xi-s.jpg?itok=lvyC7_qA\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Quest-XI-Elusive-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B07NQGDXRY?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58011YYr\" title=\"\">$50 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>Defeat the Darkspawn</p>\n<p>This gorgeous game allows you to play in either HD, 3D graphics, or with retro-style 16-bit visuals.

This is an enhanced adventure that combines the 3D version of the game, previously released on both PS4 and PC, as well as the 16-bit version that was released exclusively in Japan on the 3DS. Many folks are saying that playing Dragon Quest XI on Switch is the best way to enjoy the game, and I heartily agree.\nThe cartoony visuals, vibrant landscapes, turn-based combat, and fantasy storyline all feel at home on Switch devices. What's more, the improved music, added character storylines, and gorgeous 2D mode all work together to make this the best version of the game that I've seen yet. Seriously, if you haven't picked this game up for your Switch you really ought to.\nIt tells the tale of an unnamed protagonist who discovers early on that he's, not only an orphaned prince but also the Luminary - a magical individual who's responsible f...",

U.S District Judge Hawood S. Gilliam Jr is sitting in a class action lawsuit filed against Apple in December.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit purports that Apple's claims about the size of its OLED displays, namely size and pixel count, are fraudulent because they don't take into account the phone's rounded corners or the infamous notch. According to the report from <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/04/nobody-in-america-cares-about-pixel-loss-caused-by-iphone-notch-says-judge\">AppleInsider</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple's legal counsel, Tiffany Cheung of Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP, argued that the screen size claims are defeated by multiple disclosures on the packaging of the iPhones in question. She went on to state that the plaintiffs allege Apple is miscounting subpixels, though Apple makes no representation about subpixels in its marketing.</p>\n<p>C.K. Lee of Lee Litigation Group PLLC, representing the plaintiffs, argued that Apple could have told consumers the advertised pixel count is &quot;not true pixels,&quot; which would reduce the overall resolution.</p>\n<p>Judge Gilliam remained skeptical, and believes that other judges have set precedent barring the plaintiffs from asserting class consumer protection. However, he said that he would take the arguments under submission.</p>\n<p>The suit accuses Apple of being misleading about the screen size of the iPhone X, declared as 5.8 inches. According to the filing, the screen is actually &quot;only about 5.6875 inches,&quot; and takes issue with the 5.8-inch measurement &quot;pretending that the screen does not have rounded corners.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Judge Gilliam does seem right, in that this is a very small number of pixels to be going to court over. However, we shouldn't underestimate the importance of the case, given that the plaintiff is calling for an injuction against the practice and damage payments to be made to everyone named in the action.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/r4lDLQPoEew\" height=\"1\">",

The company uses a tire pattern on both sides that should offer most users a comfortable grip that helps prevent any slipping.</p>\n<p>As for the features, Cozycase's advanced dual-layer case delivers an IP68 waterproof rating along with a military standard that can withstand drops from 6 \u00bd feet.

Luckily, Temdan's waterproof case does away with that norm with its clear ultra-thin offering. It completely blankets your iPhone 11, by not only covering the front and back of the phone but the glass part of the camera along with the lenses all with durable plastic.</p>\n<p>Besides having a ruggedized frame, there are other noteworthy features to mention, like the fact that it is IP68 certified with the ability to withstand being submerged under 6.6-feet of water for up to 30 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>IP68 waterproof</li>\n<li>Supports wireless charging</li>\n<li>Affordably priced</li>\n<li>Shockproof and dustproof</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>Fingerprint magnet</li>\n<li>Lack of colors</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Value</h2>\n<h3>Temdan Waterproof Case</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-waterproof-cases-iphone-11\" title=\"Best Waterproof Cases for iPhone 11 in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/temdan_waterproof_iphone_11_case.jpg?itok=iwowNMaM\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Temdan-Waterproof-iPhone-11-Shockproof/dp/B07WXKXK3F?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58119YYr\">$20 from Amazon</a></li>\n</ul><p>Waterproof and dustproof protection</p>\n<p>Having an IP68 certification provides the right comfort that your phone will be protected.</p>\n\n<h2>Best Versatility: <em>Armor-X Waterproof Case</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-waterproof-cases-iphone-11\" title=\"Best Waterproof Cases for iPhone 11 in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/armor-x-iphone-11-waterproof-case-640x480.jpg?itok=r7kSgVB-\"></a></p>\n<p>This case delivers some unique durability and versatility not seen often. Armor-X's case brings an IP68 waterproofing that is fully submersible for more than six feet and up to one hour. It has shockproof capabilities that allow it to withstand drops up to four feet, which complies with military standards.</p>\n<p>So, enough with all the technical mumbo jumbo, and let's jump into all the cool bells and whistles that Armor-X's case comes with. For starters, the case comes with what the company calls an ActiveKey with a grip strap, an integrated X-MOUNT adaptor, magnet holder, and carabiner. These accessories allow you to use the case in multiple situations, both indoor and outdoor. You can easily hang it on your backpack, strap it to your wrist, or stick it on your fridge.</p>\n<p>If you pay a little extra cash, you can grab you an X-MOUNT designed for mounting the case on your bike, putting it on your belt, or armband.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>IP68 waterproof</li>\n<li>Comes with accessories</li>\n<li>Meets military drop standard</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>No color options</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Versatility</h2>\n<h3>Armor-X Waterproof Case</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-waterproof-cases-iphone-11\" title=\"Best Waterproof Cases for iPhone 11 in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/xmx-iphxr_2019-bk-iphone-xr-2019-armor-x-armorx-ip68-waterproof-shockproof-rugged-case-cases-cover-with-carabiner_3.jpg?itok=mTpfdW1b\"></a></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.armor-x.com/mx-iph-11-bk-iphone-11-waterproof-case-2019-ip68-shock-water-proof-cover-w-x-mount-carabiner.html\">$70 from Armor-X</a></li>\n</ul><p>Hang it anywhere</p>\n<p>This case can be hung anywhere with its grip strap and stuck on any metal surface, due to its magnet holder.</p>\n\n<h2>Best Against Water: <em>Moonmini Waterproof Case</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-waterproof-cases-iphone-11\" title=\"Best Waterproof Cases for iPhone 11 in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/moonmini_waterproof_iphone_11_case-640x480.jpg?itok=bvwpp64I\"></a></p>\n<p>This case meets and exceeds military standards by being able to withstand a 6 \u00bd foot drop, due to its durable TPU material with hard plastic.

The review, posted by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3444220/apple-arcade-could-rock-on-apple-tv-4k-with-better-optimization.html#tk.rss_news\">Macworld</a> suggested that whilst Apple Arcade's game are &quot;amazing&quot;, some of them seem to be suffering from severe optimization problems at 4K resolution.</p>\n<p>As per the story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, Apple Arcade games are amazing on the Apple TV 4K\u2014provided, that is, you can get them to run properly. Frogger in Toy Town has frame rates so low in the opening cutscene that it sometimes resembles stop-animation. I couldn't even get The Pinball Wizard to run past the initial story cutscene, and so I had to content myself with watching the loading animation spin for several minutes before I finally gave up. Note, though, that these are extreme examples: With most games, I'd see only occasional frame rate drops, even in graphically complex titles like Oceanhorn 2. Even so, these problems didn't exist on the iPad and iPhone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The report goes on to suggest that the issue is almost certainly optimization based, rather than a hardware issue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple's hardware should be more than capable of handling existing Apple Arcade games, as the Apple TV 4K comes with an A10X Fusion chip with 64-bit architecture running at 2.3GHz, along with 3GB of RAM. Compare that to the Nintendo Switch, which has an Nvidia Tegra X1 for the GPU and a combination CPU featuring the quad-core Cortex A57 and quad-core-A53 running at 1GHz, along 4GB of RAM.</p>\n<p>This is sort of an &quot;apples to oranges&quot; comparison, but rough Geekbench 5 benchmarks for iPhones and iPads using an A10X Fusion suggest the Apple TV 4K should soundly trounce the Switch in most cases, yet the Switch rarely has a problem handling games as intense as id Software's 2016 Doom remake. Apple Arcade currently doesn't have any game approaching that kind of complexity, and I don't think the Switch's extra gig of RAM is going to make that much of a difference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reports aren't confined to this review, and there are some reports across Twitter that performance seems to be a problem on the Apple TV 4K.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A big problem I found, messing around with Apple Arcade games on the Apple TV last night, is that performance is a big issue for a lot of the games that rely on 3D graphics. ChuChu Rocket and Frogger both run at like 10\u201315 FPS on my Apple TV 4K. <a href=\"https://t.co/G1lj2KTg39\">https://t.co/G1lj2KTg39</a></p>\u2014 nick (@The24thFrame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The24thFrame/status/1177220605776683008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 26, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>The review is quick to point out that the problems only seemed to occur when playing games at 4K resolution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I went into the Settings app and brought the video format down to 1080p SDR, I had no trouble running any Apple Arcade games at all. All of this leads me to believe poor optimization is the true culprit here, either within tvOS itself or in the hands of developers who may have spent more time optimizing their games for the iPhone and iPad.</p>\n</blockquote></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/hdTlEQa4BsM\" height=\"1\">",

If you want that, then I recommend checking out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/iphone-11-pro-disney-after-dark/\">Matthew Panzarino's iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro review at Techcrunch</a>. Instead, I'm going to go over how great the iPhone 11 Pro camera is for a very frequent Disneyland guest, or just anyone, in general, visiting Disneyland Resort on a vacation.</p>\n<h2>The best camera is always the one that is with you</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/iphone-11-pro-midnight-green-cameras-hero.jpg?itok=v9U5kawg\"></a></p>\n<p>For years, I've gone by the motto of &quot;the best camera is the one that's with you.&quot; I've always had an interest in photography, and even took classes in high school and college. I bought point-and-shoot cameras just to try and make the most of my hobby, but I always found it a bit of a hassle to bring a separate camera with me on top of everything else. I always ended up just snapping photos with a cell phone, especially once I got an iPhone.</p>\n<p>Ever since then, with all of the advancements made in the iPhone camera, I have had no desire to buy a digital camera or even a DSLR. I always have my phone with me, and it's perfectly capable of taking good photos that I could make great with some post-processing work, so why add another thing to my daily carry?</p>\n<p>Honestly, as a child, I didn't get to go to Disneyland very much due to cost. I only began to go frequently because my now-husband and his family have always been going to Disneyland, and I got an Annual Pass as an anniversary gift one year, and have continued renewing it since.</p>\n<p>I've been going to Disneyland at least once a week or a few times a month since (gotta get that money's worth), and it's become my new zen for iPhone photography since I have it with me all the time and find it annoying to carry more than what is needed.</p>\n<p>With the iPhone 11 Pro cameras, I truly feel less of a need for having a standalone camera than ever before.</p>\n<h2>It's time to go Ultra Wide</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/10/downtown-disney-lego-maleficent-ultra-wide.jpg?itok=oeA60gfg\"></a></p>\n<p>Apple improves the iPhone camera every year, but this is definitely one of the biggest improvements since the iPhone 8 series and the ability to do Portrait Lighting with Portrait Mode. With the iPhone 11, there is the new Ultra-Wide 13mm lens. The new Ultra-Wide camera allows for 120-degree fields of view, allows you to capture more of the surrounding environments in every photo, and gets some amazing panorama-like shots, depending on how you frame and compose the image.</p>\n<p>While at Disneyland over the weekend, I managed to use the Ultra-Wide several times during the day to get some gorgeous shots that were never possible before with my iPhone XS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/elliot-main-street-electrical-parade-ultra-wide.jpg?itok=NvmhKQFy\"></a></p>\n<p>I could capture the entire Millennium Falcon in a single angled Ultra Wide shot, similar to how they do it with the PhotoPass photographers. The Ultra-Wide also let me capture more of other scenes, such as the Pixie's Hollow fountain in front of Tomorrowland, Elliott the Dragon in the Main Street Electrical Parade, the &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; display in Haunted Mansion Holiday as I rode off in a Doom Buggy, and various decorations and displays all over Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, and Downtown Disney.</p>\n<p>The Ultra-Wide camera would also be great for capturing larger groups of people, such as family and friends, especially against walls and backdrops. However, it's usually just my husband and me, so I didn't get a chance to test that out. Panzarino has also seen success in using the Ultra-Wide camera for up-close shots of people and intimate moments, so while it may not be for everyone, that's another use case for the Ultra Wide.</p>\n<div><div>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/10/cinderella-carriage-ultra-wide.jpg?itok=2LN9Hdhy\"></a><a

Mode</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/10/disney-california-adventure-entrance-night-mode.jpg?itok=4ChwSpgc\"></a></p>\n<p>If you aren't into the Ultra-Wide perspective, that's fine. But the other major camera upgrade with the iPhone 11 this year is Night Mode, and I swear, this alone makes it worth upgrading, even if you have an XS from last year.</p>\n<p>Night Mode happens automatically, and it isn't something that you can turn on manually, unfortunately. But it will come in quite often when you take pictures in low light or complete darkness, because the camera sense it and knows Night Mode will help you out. And this is where the iPhone 11 really shines, especially during a Disneyland trip.</p>\n<p>While Disneyland is quite enjoyable during daylight, it's absolutely fantastic at night. The lights and sights during their nighttime shows, they're absolutely not to be missed, especially for those who don't get to go to Disneyland as often. And with Night Mode, those nighttime pictures have never looked better.</p>\n<p>For Night Mode to kick in, the light threshold needs to fall below a certain level. Once that happens, the triple-lens camera system and computational software will pull in as much light as possible from the current environment to create the photo. This results in a brightened up images, but you can still tell that they're taken at night, rather than day. It takes multiple photos with different angles over a set interval (between two to 10 seconds), analyzes them for things like sharpness and light, and creates a single photo. The difference between my nighttime Disneyland photos from my old iPhone XS and my new iPhone 11 Pro is like night and day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/elliot-main-street-electrical-parade-wide-angle.jpg?itok=kLTx5L9v\"></a></p>\n<p>I never thought that my iPhone XS took bad photos at night, I mean, they weren't too shabby when I had it. But the iPhone 11 Pro blows it out of the water. I replicated a few of my favorite night shots that I took with the XS with my 11 Pro, and it's as clear as it could be. The iPhone 11 Pro Night mode shots came out much brighter with more vivid colors and incredible amounts of detail than I had ever got before.</p>\n<p>You can clearly see the Evil Queen peeking out of the window while seeing the rest of the Snow White's Scary Adventures building lit up by the nearby Sleeping Beauty's castle. Every bit of the detail of the Millennium Falcon shows up. The fireworks in the sky during the Halloween Screams show are crisp and clear against a lit-up sky, and you can still see everyone on Main Street while the projections play on the walls. If you happen to stop in the right spot on one of Disney's dark rides, then you can capture a beautiful and amazing shot, like daydreaming Sally or Hatbox Ghost in the Haunted Mansion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/10/millennium-falcon-night-mode.jpg?itok=XtyYwcUh\"></a></p>\n<p>While Night mode is the biggest upgrade on the iPhone 11, you need to remember that it's most effective when you and the subject can be still for a few seconds. Otherwise, it might just end up a blurry picture that won't impress anyone. I found it a little annoying that I can't just toggle on Night mode manually. It activates only when it senses that it's needed.</p>\n<p>If you were hoping to combine the Ultra-Wide lens and Night mode, then you'll also be disappointed, because it's impossible. The Ultra-Wide lens does not have focus pixels or optical image stabilization (OIS), which are both needed for Night mode. It also turns out that, when you zoom in 2x with Night Mode, you're not actually using the telephoto lens. Instead, the Camera system crops in the photo from the standard wide lens to where the 2x zoom would be. The actual telephoto lens with optical zoom is not capturing the image with Night mode.</p>\n<div><div>\n<a

regular Wide camera lens?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my

standouts with the new iPhone 11 Pro this year are the new Ultra-Wide camera and Night mode, that doesn't mean that the normal Wide lens didn't get any improvements.</p>\n<p>I usually just take photos with the Wide lens unless I specifically need the Ultra Wide for more scenery or telephoto for getting up close from far away. I have noticed that the iPhone 11 Pro Wide camera takes much more vibrant photos, with more realistic and true-to-life colors as compared with my old iPhone XS. I never thought that the iPhone XS camera was bad, but when you retake some photos and compare them side-by-side, the iPhone 11 Pro images just look much better.</p>\n<div><div>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-dcaentrance-comparison.jpg?itok=hM-Ut4R4\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-dcaentrance-comparison.jpg?itok=hM-Ut4R4\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-evilqueen-comparison.jpg?itok=OdXKWYmz\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-evilqueen-comparison.jpg?itok=OdXKWYmz\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-hauntedmansion-comparison.jpg?itok=l-PopvfO\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-hauntedmansion-comparison.jpg?itok=l-PopvfO\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-hauntedmansionholiady-comparison.jpg?itok=-LA5-JKC\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-hauntedmansionholiady-comparison.jpg?itok=-LA5-JKC\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-kylostiefighter-comparison.jpg?itok=V10eNgTA\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-kylostiefighter-comparison.jpg?itok=V10eNgTA\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-sleeping-beauty-castle-comparison.jpg?itok=YgF4MoNL\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-only-camera-you-need-day-disneyland\" title=\"I took my iPhone 11 Pro to Disneyland and shot the best photos in my life!\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/iphonexs-iphone11pro-sleeping-beauty-castle-comparison.jpg?itok=YgF4MoNL\"></a></div> </div>\n<p>Unfortunately, I go so often that I can't remember what pictures I've taken with my old iPhones, so I couldn't replicate every shot that I've taken in the past (there are too many to count!)

While the letter acknowledges that Facebook \u2014 which owns Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram \u2014 captures 99% of child exploitation and terrorism-related content through its own systems, it also notes that &quot;mere numbers cannot capture the significance of the harm to children.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Risks to public safety from Facebook's proposals are exacerbated in the context of a single platform that would combine inaccessible messaging services with open profiles, providing unique routes for prospective offenders to identify and groom our children,&quot; the letter reads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Messages sent over Facebook-owned service WhatsApp are already encrypted. Users can also encrypt their Facebook messages by using Secret Chat within the mobile messenger app. Facebook is planning to bring end-to-end encryption to all of its messaging services as standard, including Instagram.</p>\n<p>The letter goes on to state:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content, even for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes. This puts our citizens and societies at risk by severely eroding a company's ability to detect and respond to illegal content and activity, such as child sexual exploitation and abuse, terrorism, and foreign adversaries' attempts to undermine democratic values and institutions, preventing the prosecution of offenders and safeguarding of victims. It also impedes law enforcement's ability to investigate these and other serious crimes. Risks to public safety from Facebook's proposals are exacerbated in the context of a single platform that would combine inaccessible messaging services with open profiles, providing unique routes for prospective offenders to identify and groom our children.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The letter concludes by calling on Facebook (and other companies) to &quot;enable law enforcement to obtain lawful acces to content in a readable and usable format&quot;, and not to implement the proposed changes until it can ensure the system would maintain the safety of its users.</p>\n<p>In response to the letter as reported by <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-security-exclusive/u-s-allies-urge-facebook-for-backdoor-to-encryption-as-they-fight-child-abuse-idUKKBN1WI22L\">Reuters</a>, Facebook has hit back at calls to halt encryption measures:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Facebook said in a statement that it strongly opposes &quot;government efforts to build backdoors,&quot; which it said would undermine privacy and security.</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg said on Thursday he had been aware of child exploitation risks before announcing his encryption plan and acknowledged that it would reduce tools to fight the problem.</p>\n<p>Speaking in a livestream of the company's weekly internal Q&amp;A session, he said he was &quot;optimistic&quot; that Facebook would be able to identify predators even in encrypted systems using the same tools it used to fight election interference, like patterns of activity and links between accounts on different platforms.</p>\n<p>He also suggested the company might further limit the ways adults can interact with minors on Facebook's platforms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The news comes in the wake of a deal struck between the UK and US for a data access agreement, which the BBC says is &quot;designed to remove the barriers to cross-border surveillance&quot;. British law-encofrcement agencies can now demand data relating to terroism, child sex abuse and other serious crime from US tech firms in just a few days, a process that could previously have taken up to 2 years.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/ih6yVKOSALo\" height=\"1\">",

Specifically, it covers the idea of a stretchable band integrated into the fabric of a garment for monitoring of health data.</p>\n<p>The patent is titled &quot;Fabric-Based Items With Stretchable Bands&quot; and the abstract states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A fabric-based item may be provide with a stretchable band. The stretchable band may be formed from a ring-shaped strip of stretchable fabric having an opening configured to fit around a body part of a user. Circuitry may be coupled to strands of material in the stretchable band. The circuitry may include sensor circuitry for making measurements on the body part such as electrocardiogram measurements, blood pressure measurements, and respiration rate measurements. Wireless communications circuitry in the fabric-based item may be used to communicate wirelessly with external electronic equipment. A wireless power transmitting device may transmit wireless power. A coil formed from conductive strands in the fabric-based item may be used by wireless power receiving circuitry in the fabric-based item to receive the wireless power. The coil may have one or more turns that run around the ring-shaped strip of stretchable fabric.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-patent-could-point-smart-clothing-could-measure-health-data\" title=\"Apple patent could point to &quot;smart clothing&quot; that measures health data\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/stretchable-band-clothing-patent.jpg?itok=-tqausfA\"></a></p>\n<p>According to the report from Patently Apple, it seems that the technology could be used in smart clothing (and accessories) to &quot;measure health vitals and even provide another way for taking an ECG and much more. It may even work in concert with Apple Watch to take more accurate ECG readings.&quot; Patently Apple also notes that one of listed inventors is none other than Daniel Podhajny, who worked on Nike's Flyknit material and is listed in several patents related to it. Indeed, it is stated within the filing that &quot;This relates generally to items with fabric and, more particularly, to items with stretchable fabric.&quot;</p>\n<p>Whilst the idea of wearable, smart clothing sounds fantastic, the most obvious problem would seem to be keeping it clean... Just ask anyone who has put their old iPhone through a washer/dryer. Within the body of the patent, there are provisions made so that the fabric-based technology could sustain &quot;relatively high temperatures such as those associated with laundering of clothing&quot;, and the dangers of water.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, the fabric-based item may have supercapacitors for energy storage and other electrical components that can be laundered in hot water and dried in a clothes dryer without damage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Via <a href=\"http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220190298265%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20190298265&RS=DN/20190298265\">USPTO</a></em></p>\n<p>Like the Apple Watch needs iPhone, wearable tech would need a hub device to connect to, and the summary notes that the circuitry would include wireless communications tech within the fabric-based item, so as to allow communication with &quot;external electronic equipment&quot;, which could perhaps be a phone or a watch.</p>\n<p>As always, a published Apple patent is not confirmation of future Apple tech, however the idea that one day we might be able to wear clothes that measure our vital signs is fascinating. Wearable tech is not new by any means, but the idea that sensors and circuitry could be integrated into the fabric of our clothes is certainly a fascinating prospect. The only question that remains is at which stage of the laundering process does one charge your workout t-shirt?</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/pn5JFw_SB5U\" height=\"1\">",

Speaking to French newspaper <em>Les Echos</em> and first reported by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/03/tim-cook-weighs-in-against-launching-an-apple-cryptocurrency.html\">CNBC</a>, Tim Cook expressed discomfort at the idea of a private company creating a cryptocurrency. According to their report</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When asked whether Apple would follow suit, Cook told Les Echos daily newspaper it was not on his agenda.</p>\n<p>&quot;No. I really think that a currency should stay in the hands of countries. I'm not comfortable with the idea of a private group setting up a competing currency,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>&quot;A private company shouldn't be looking to gain power this way.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The report notes a CNN article from <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/05/tech/apple-pay-vp-jennifer-bailey-table-interview/index.html\">September</a> where Jennifer Bailey, VP of Apple Pay said &quot;We're watching cryptocurrency&quot;, describing it as &quot;interesting&quot; and having &quot;long-term potential&quot;.</p>\n<p>Clearly now it seems she may have meant they were &quot;watching cryptocurrency&quot; with some disdain. Whilst many thought Bailey's comments could have signalled Apple's long term ambition to swipe a slice of the cryptocurrency pie, this latest story does appear to reveal that this is definitely not the case. Coming just 3 months after Facebook announced its cryptocurreny <em>Libra</em>, this is probably as close as we will get to a direct comment from Apple on the move from the social media giant.</p>\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/03/tim-cook-europe-tour-italy/\">MacRumors</a>, Cook also discussed other topics with the outlet including immigration, journalisam and fake news:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Cook, while the internet has brought &quot;many positive things,&quot; fake news is one negative. From a translation of the original interview:\nAll of us lovers of democracy and freedom must think that separating the false from the true is the basis of freedom. Quality journalism is the foundation of every democracy and an open and free press is essential.\nCook also spoke about a topic that he's covered many times in the past - privacy. He reiterated his belief that Apple customers are not Apple's product, and that Apple will not sell customer data. &quot;At Apple, we will never treat you as products but as customers with dignity and respect,&quot; he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So there you have it. Apple's will not be joining the cryptocurrency fray anytime soon, perhaps maybe never... at least not on Tim Cook's (Apple) Watch.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/EjP_RIVCL1s\" height=\"1\">",

But it's not like you'll get 9000 cards to start with \u2014 you need to spend time playing the single-player campaign to earn Duel Points (DP) to spend on booster packs.</p>\n<p>But what's in each booster pack? What's a good pack to start with if you want to build a custom deck to use instead of the iconic Story Decks for each campaign duel? Fret not, fellow Duelists! We're here to help.</p>\n<p>I would highly recommend starting the campaign with the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series, and then going in order from there. Not only will you start with the basics (and then work your way up), but there are some good archetypes that you can get with just the booster packs from the original series, such as Red Eyes Black Dragon, Blue Eyes White Dragon, and Dark Magician.</p>\n<p>Since there are over 9000 cards total in the game, we probably won't be able to list every single one here (there are also other resources online for that).

Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution Booster Pack Guide\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/08/ygo-lotd-le-related-cards.jpg?itok=jZ81YVRw\"></a></p>\n<p>I know, with all of these different archetypes, it can be a bit overwhelming, especially if you're new or just returning to Yu-Gi-Oh! after a few years and haven't been keeping up with the meta of the trading card game.</p>\n<p>I think a good way to start in Link Evolution is with the first series, as it is not too complicated and you can get some good cards to make a solid deck with to get through a good chunk of the campaigns.</p>\n<p>Personally, I would recommend starting with a Red Eyes Black Dragon deck, as it is the one I'm currently using to get through the story duels. I'm in the GX series now, and it's still holding up well. Just keep going for the Joey Wheeler packs until you get enough to make a solid deck, and then continue to perfect it before moving on to another deck build.</p>\n<p>The gist of the Red Eyes deck revolves around the Joey's signature Red Eyes Black Dragon, and you'll have a ton of cards to quickly get it out on the field through Special Summon (Red Eyes Baby Dragon, The Black Stone of Legend, Return of the Red-Eyes), and keep it out there, along with other Red-Eyes cards.</p>\n<p>It's not hard to swarm the enemy with a lot of high-level Red Eyes cards in the first few turns, and it will be hard for them to get rid of your dragons, especially if they can keep coming back. Get the Xyz summon, Red-Eyes Black Flare Metal Dragon out, and your opponent will take 500 points of damage to their life points anytime they activate a card or effect until they can get rid of it.</p>\n<p>The Red-Eyes deck is pretty strong and should be beginner-friendly, and will help you get through the story duels quicker. The Blue Eyes White Dragon can also be quite strong, and the Dark Magician is quite fun to play.</p>\n<h2>Just keep playing to earn that sweet DP</h2>\n<p>Yes, the game has a lot of cards for you to collect and use in decks. I mean, there are over 9000, for cryin' out loud! That leaves a lot of possibilities for decks and play styles, but how do you get that DP to get those booster packs? It's easy: just keep playing the game.</p>\n<p>Once you have a deck that you're comfortable using and can win through story duels without much struggling, just keep using it. Getting through story duels, especially the earlier campaigns, should be a breeze if you have constructed a decent deck (keep it as close to 40 cards as possible for best results). As you duel, whether you win or lose, you'll get DP. If you just keep at it, then you'll have a lot of DP saved up, and then you can just go wild in the Card Shop. Just have an idea of the kind of cards you're looking for, whether it's to improve your current deck or make a new one, and keep going for those packs.</p>\n<p>Then when you're out of DP, just duel some more. You know the drill: lather, rinse, repeat.</p>\n<h2>It's time to duel!</h2>\n<p>I hope that this guide helps some of you when it comes to determining which booster packs to get. With over 9000 cards available to collect in the game, the possibilities are quite literally endless here, and there's a lot of room for experimentation.</p>\n<p>Have any tips of your own?

A small liberal democracy is standing up to a gargantuan authoritarian communist dictatorship with a superpower-grade military force.</p>\n<p>Apple is reliant on China in two ways: they manufacture most of their products there, and the Chinese market is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/technology/apple-revenue-decline-china.html\">roughly equal to all of Europe</a> as Apple\u2019s second biggest for sales. If Apple wants to avoid any suspicion that the company is kowtowing to China, they need to avoid any inadvertent screw-ups in a case like this. Everything related to the App Store approval process that might be perceived as kowtowing to China should receive the utmost scrutiny.</p>\n<p>This one doesn\u2019t pass the test.</p>\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Apple and Hong Kong\u2019\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/03/apple-hong-kong-map\">\u00a0\u2605\u00a0</a>\n</div>"

This new feature allows for a quick visual preview of the potential effects of a search or replace operation.\nIn addition, BBEdit 13 adds support for multiple selection and editing via three new commands to select Live Search results, matches for the currently selected text, or the current search string in the Find window. Once selected, editing one instance changes them all.\nBBEdit 13 introduces a new &quot;Apply Transform&quot; command, which provides a powerful, immediate means to apply any single text transformation to multiple files and folders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The update also adds a new &quot;Pattern Playground&quot; feature designated for handling grep patterns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The &quot;Pattern Playground&quot; window provides an interactive interface for experimenting with the behavior of Grep patterns (regular expressions). This makes the process of creating complicated patterns much less trial-and-error, since you can see exactly what will match, and how, before committing to any irreversible actions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The BBEdit 13 update is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bbedit/id404009241?mt=12\" title=\"\">now available</a> through the App Store. If you don't own it, BBEdit is available for $50. Those who are one BBEdit 12 can upgrade for just $30, and those who are on older an version can update for $40. However, those who purchased BBEdit after May 1, 2019 can upgrade for free.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/fZ4Vcmsgy64\" height=\"1\">",

The company on Thursday <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/\" title=\"\">published</a> new developer updates with some helpful information about what changes are in store.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, Apple has reminded developers to submit their apps to the Mac App Store.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>macOS Catalina will soon be available to hundreds of millions of users around the world. With macOS Catalina, your Mac apps can take advantage of Sign in with Apple, Sidecar, and the latest advances in Core ML 3, and Metal. And with Mac Catalyst, you can bring your iPad apps to Mac.

And their success to date, I think, bears that out. They just don't sell as well as they should. Because they're pretty fantastic tech. Tech that, by definition, is forced to think different. And tech that Apple could learn a thing or three from.</p>\n<p>Including and especially this week's Microsoft event in New York City.</p>\n<h2>Foldables</h2>\n<p>I've said it innumerable times already: The history of human technology is the history of foldables. From books to wallets, flip phones to laptops. We just love taking big, wide things and folding them smaller if thicker to carry around.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we'll go that way with at least some modern, mobile devices as well. Eventually.</p>\n<p>Apple's reportedly been kicking around foldable projects since back in the days of iPhone 4 but hasn't found anything they'd be happy turning into a shipping product yet. For them, the technology just isn't mature enough yet.</p>\n<p>And that's ok. That's Apple. There were years of Windows Mobile and a decade of Tablet PC before we got the iPhone and iPad, and Microsoft Spot before we got the Apple Watch.</p>\n<p>Apple wants to learn from this before they do that. But for us nerds, this is still super interesting.</p>\n<p>Now, what Microsoft showed off weren't technically foldables. They were more like\u2026 hingeables?</p>\n<p>Tech media is going to continue to misuse the term innovation to mean stunt or gimmick or dopamine hit to their increasingly bored and cynical brain stems, or in this case, experiment, and that's fine. That's the topic for a future video.</p>\n<p>But, experiment is what these are. And that's also fine.</p>\n<p>My colleague, Windows Central's Daniel Rubino, has a full video up on all this, so check that out, but here's my scorching hot take.</p>\n<p>They're not single-screen devices like Samsung's just-launched Galaxy Fold or Huawei's still-to-come Mate X. They're dual-screen devices. Two identically sized displays hinged together.</p>\n<p>We've seen the concept before but this implementation is super slick, with all the hardware panache we've come to expect from Microsoft's Surface line.</p>\n<p>The Neo, the bigger of the two, has dual 9-inch displays and runs Windows 10X, a new version of Windows based on the same Windows Core\u2026 core that also runs HoloLens 2 and Xbox One.</p>\n<p>Since the hinge bends all the way around, you can open it partially to use it like AD&amp;D Player's Handbook-sized tome, lay it out flat like a Monopoly board for full-sized tablet fun, fold all the way back, like a paperback, for more one-handed, half-sized tablet action, or snap it shut to keep those two screens safe while not in use.</p>\n<p>You can also prop it up like a laptop and even flip around this really cool little hardware keyboard and mount it low to use the remaining screen like a giant emoji-strewn Touch Bar, or higher up, to enable a faux touchpad.</p>\n<p>Two hinged screens aren't as awesome looking, and certainly, aren't as swipe-across friendly as true foldable screens\u2026 but they aren't as fragile yet either. The true end game is true foldables with truly touch screen tech and full-on haptic control simulation, so you don't need accessories. The screen can just feel like keys or dials or sliders or whatever control surface you need or want.</p>\n<p>But we're still a long way from that, and this is a differently compromised idea from the Galaxy Fold to get us one differently diagonal step there.</p>\n<p>The Duo is a smaller version of the Neo, with twin 5.6-inch displays. Microsoft is calling it a phone but, honestly, given the aspect ratio looks far more like those old Android tablets that had phone apps, which is probably why they didn't show too many shots of people holding them up to their heads.</p>\n<p>Which, you know, in the era of AirPods and Surface Buds, is totally fine with me. I'd love it if iPads could take and make phone calls directly.</p>\n<p>Now, the bigger news about the smaller hingeable is that it runs not Windows 10X but Android\u2026</p>\n<p>Yeah. Android.</p>\n<p>People will try to frame this like, if you know Satya Nadella then you saw this coming. But if you know Bill Gates and Steve Balmer, then you know they never saw this coming.</p>\n<p>They never expected all of us to be running around with little Nix boxes in our pockets, surfing the web on KHTML-based browsers.</p>\n<p>The power of software. A PC in every home. Windows everywhere. That was their future.</p>\n<p>And, I totally get that it's a pragmatic choice and probably a smart one. If you can't be Apple or Google you better damn well be WeChat.</p>\n<p>But I also can't help but feel that we're all a little lesser for it. A world where Microsoft could have scaled Windows Core down to phones, would be a world with one more choice than Apple or Google.</p>\n<p>But Android is so ubiquitous and so free, it's going to take a company with as much gumption as Google to do to them what they did to Windows. And likely only when the next paradigm shift occurs.</p>\n<p>So, in my mind palace, I'm going to pretend this is just a stop-gap. A way to buy time so AzureOS, a fully cloud-centric, AI-powered operating system can ramp up and start being deployed across multi-form endpoints of all shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>Yup, that's what I'm going to pretend. Even while I try to figure out how Microsoft is going to square their commitments to privacy with Google's all-consuming operating system running root level on their devices.</p>\n<p>Now, neither the Neo nor the Duo are coming to market until the end of 2020 at the earliest. More than a year from now. For the Neo, that's easy to understand.</p>\n<p>Microsoft is showing it off now because it's really less product and more ecosystem jump-starter. Microsoft hopes, I think, all their device partners will try to meet or beat them to market so there will be a critical enough hardware mass to compel software support from developers.</p>\n<p>And, I mean\u2026 I hope?</p>\n<p>Windows Phone was terrific and inspired both Android and iOS towards more minimal design. But it never got developer support and so Microsoft MDK'd it.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Google, even with the strongest of strong-arms at times, hasn't been able to get Android developers to make enough tablet-optimized apps to make Android tablets a thing. And they've MDK'd their own Pixel Slate line.</p>\n<p>So, all the capacitive input digits crossed.</p>\n<p>The Duo delay is harder to understand, though. We've seen dual-screen Android devices on the market already. So, why isn't the Duo launching <em>this</em> holiday season instead of next?</p>\n<p>It's hot and new right now, but a year from now, that ID and implementation may not hold up as well. Unless, of course, there's way more to its story than Microsoft has let on so far.</p>\n<p>And, hey, maybe the combination of foldables and hingebles will prove popular and compelling enough to get developers all up on their jammy. Yeah, I said jammy.</p>\n<p>But, we've all gotten our hopes up enough here that it's totally fair to say no one should expect it until everyone sees it.</p>\n<p>Even if some of us would really love an Apple Book \u2014 an iPad mini that would fold out into an iPad\u2026 and an iPad that would fold out into a full-sized Pro.</p>\n<h2>ARM &amp; AMD</h2>\n<p>Now, there were some actual shipping Surface products announced this week as well, and some of them were kinda all shades of audacious in their own rights.</p>\n<p>Again, Daniel Rubino and Windows Central are all over this, but here's the scorching gist:</p>\n<p>The Surface Pro X is like the 2018 iPad Pro redesign for the Surface line. War on bezels, check. USB C, check. Actually, check check because there's two of them. That's something I'd love on an iPad Pro.</p>\n<p>And the Surface Pro X runs Windows 10\u2026 no, not X, because there's not a company in tech that can seemingly resist making that letter numeral non-confusing\u2026 but Windows 10 for ARM.</p>\n<p>That's right. No Intel inside. No sticker on deck. None. Instead, you have a Microsoft SQ1 made in partnership with Qualcomm, with Microsoft's own AI engine. Maybe something akin to the 8cx+, with Kyro just slightly faster than the 855+, and DirectX direct-injected? I dunno. Hopefully time will tell.</p>\n<p>Microsoft's device partners haven't exactly raced to get Windows on Arm products of their own onto the shelves, so this again might be as much prod as product.</p>\n<p>Either way, it just makes me salivate at the idea of a new MacBook running something A13X-like, and like yesterday. Not just for power efficiency either. At this point, just for flat out power in that kind of profile.</p>\n<p>The other big silicon news was on the opposite end of the Surface Spectrum: The new 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 is also bereft of Intel and, instead, is packing AMD.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm far more excited about AMD costs and core-counts on desktop than I am mobile, but\u2026. It's still great to see them making inroads into platform companies.</p>\n<p>We'll have to wait and see how they perform, but while we do, I'll just be over here all low key dreaming about a ThreadRipper iMac Pro.</p>\n<h2>Repairability</h2>\n<p>There were a lot of thoughtful, delightful little design touches across the Surface hardware line, including how the pen is hidden away inside the keyboard.</p>\n<p>But the biggest and best was internal access. I straight-up kind of loved up the way Panos Panay just ripped the keyboard off the Surface Laptop to show that it was more repairable, more upgradeable, than Surfaces past.</p>\n<p>Now, everything is a compromise. Unibodies provide incredible strength and structural support, but they make replacements more all-encompassing and expensive. Pop-offs, well, they can pop off just like snaps can snap off. But they make it much easier to get into the guts of the machine and, theoretically, more affordable to repair.</p>\n<p>I say theoretically only because there are reports that the new Surface Laptop is really only easier for Microsoft to get into and repair or upgrade for you with warranty intact. Which is still better if not the best. And DIYers are super resourceful. But, it's such early days that it's hard to tell how exactly, and legally that will play out. Besides, I'm an optimist.</p>\n<p>Either way, I love the idea. There'd have to be some tradeoffs in terms of sleekness and solidity, of course, but having the ability to upgrade, even get upgraded, a storage module or memory module, even a communications module, wouldn't just be great for customers, it's be great for sustainability efforts as well.</p>\n<p>I just seriously upgraded my camera for these videos and I want to start shooting in RAW, and the idea of getting my MacBook Pro drive upgraded from 2TB to 4TB is\u2026 just\u2026 give it to me now.</p>\n<p>So, hopefully, this isn't just a first step but a first shove in that direction for everyone.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector\">VECTOR | Rene Ritchie</a></h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/+lastest?list=PLOPlnaz0lJJhMap8KV2MeziTUwFkSls0A\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul><li>Video: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/vectorshow\">YouTube</a></li>\n<li>Podcast: <a href=\"http://applepodcasts.com/vector\">Apple</a> | <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1313368831/vector\">Overcast</a> | <a href=\"http://pca.st/vector\">Pocket Casts</a> | <a href=\"http://vector.libsyn.com/rss\">RSS</a></li>\n<li>Column: <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector\">iMore</a> | <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector/rss\">RSS</a></li>\n<li>Social: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reneritchie\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://instagram.com/reneritchie\">Instagram</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p></p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/lGj0tXZwZFQ\" height=\"1\">",

Customization</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/why-people-are-and-arent-switching-android-iphone-2019\" title=\"Why people are \u2014\u00a0and aren't! \u2014 switching from Android to iPhone in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/04/water-resistance-iphone-xs-max-apple-watch-hero.jpeg?itok=MQsZgv21\"></a></p>\n<p>Android also excels in customizability. With the <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-review\">iPhone</a>, you're using pretty much the same system and interface as you've always used and as everyone else using it is also and has also always used.</p>\n<p>With Android, you can change up the look of almost anything and everything. Get a third-party launcher, comic sans up the fonts, throw icons across the screen like DND dice on the table.</p>\n<p>Whatever you want, whenever and however you want.</p>\n<p>Apple has added dark mode and font apps, and maybe working on an updated launcher, but again, this isn't anything they'll ever want to or be able to match.</p>\n<h2>3. Pricing</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/why-people-are-and-arent-switching-android-iphone-2019\" title=\"Why people are \u2014\u00a0and aren't! \u2014 switching from Android to iPhone in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/iphone-11-pro-midnight-green-cameras-hero.jpg?itok=v9U5kawg\"></a></p>\n<p>You can sell or trade-in your old phone to help pay for a new iPhone. You can get installment or annual upgrade payments. And you can argue about whether an iPhone that costs more will last longer, ultimately being a better value, but what you can't argue with is up front pricing.</p>\n<p>Because of Android's variety, you can find them at almost every price point, from like the $16 Jake Paralta special at the bodega, to really well-specced $400-600 mid-ranges that have most of the stuff modern flagships have, to those $1000 flagships with all the bells and whistles.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3a\">Google Pixel 3a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-review\">OnePlus 7T</a>, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g7-review\">Moto G7</a>, are all new phones that clock in at less than even Apple's couple year old but still sold new phones.</p>\n<p>And if that's all the money you have in your pocket right now for a new phone, they're compelling phones for your pocket.</p>\n<p>But, if you have other considerations or concerns, it's totally worth going through those as well.</p>\n<h2>1. The Google</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/why-people-are-and-arent-switching-android-iphone-2019\" title=\"Why people are \u2014\u00a0and aren't! \u2014 switching from Android to iPhone in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brb/public/field/image/2019/01/iphone-google-search-thumb.jpg?itok=hzrnCeEt\"></a></p>\n<p>It can be stressful, switching to a new phone. That's one of Android's big advantages. Even different devices from different manufacturers, like Samsung, LG, Google, OnePlus, whatever\u2026 they're not so different. Just log in with your Google account and, some current Huawei bans being the big exception, you're pretty much good to go.</p>\n<p>With the iPhone, you log in with an Apple ID. You may already have one from iTunes or an iPad, or it may take you a minute to set one up, but then what?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While there are valid reasons to not switch from Android to iPhone, a few reasons points should be considered, including the ability to use Google services on iPhone and having more data privacy and security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, if you want to stick with all your Google apps and services, then you just log in with your Google account all the same.</p>\n<p>You can use Apple's Switch to iOS app, which makes the whole cross-grade process simple-as-in-automated, even hunting down your existing Play Store apps for you on the App Store, you can log into it at the system level for things like email, calendar, contacts, and notes, and you can just download and log into any Google app, like Gmail.</p>\n<p>Once you do, that same login will be made available to you in any other app that uses Google login. Yes, like Pokemon Go.</p>\n<p>Google puts almost every app and service they make on the iPhone because, frankly, they make so much of their money from people using those apps and services <em>on</em> the iPhone.</p>\n<h2>2. Not the Google</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/why-people-are-and-arent-switching-android-iphone-2019\" title=\"Why people are \u2014\u00a0and aren't! \u2014 switching from Android to iPhone in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2016/03/iphone-Calendar-app-hero.jpg?itok=L0qtrcSg\"></a></p>\n<p>Now, you may have noticed something really interesting there. But, if you didn't, I'll spell it out for you.</p>\n<p>Because you're not logging into Google at the device level, Google only gets your login \u2014 and your data \u2014 for the specific apps and services you choose.</p>\n<p>If you want a full-on Google experience but with Apple hardware, because you think that's the best of both worlds, you can totally do that.</p>\n<p>But, if the reason you're switching is that you believe Android to be more data capture and surveillance device than phone, you can run an iPhone with absolutely no Google login on your end. You can use Apple services instead, or Microsoft, or stick to Indies or a variety \u2014\u00a0whatever you want.</p>\n<p>You can also pick and choose. Have Gmail and Calendar signed in but not YouTube or Maps. Aside from email someone else who uses Gmail or Gsuite, you have total control over your own stuff.</p>\n<h2>3. Privacy</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/why-people-are-and-arent-switching-android-iphone-2019\" title=\"Why people are \u2014\u00a0and aren't! \u2014 switching from Android to iPhone in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2018/11/macbook-air-2018-privacy.jpg?itok=WNlYqnwz\"></a></p>\n<p>A lot of companies are talking about privacy lately. That's not thanks to Apple. Sure, Apple has been championing it for a while, but Facebook, Google, Amazon, even Apple occasionally, have also screwed it up to the point that it's entered the public consciousness.</p>\n<p>From Cambridge Analytica or people listening in to digital cameras and assistants, to selling our selfies to train drones, it's just been a bad couple of years for them\u2026 but a worse many years for us.</p>\n<p>Facebook has begun talking about privacy, but they conflate it with encryption, and they can still get tons of our data either way.</p>\n<p>Google, likewise, has been emphasizing privacy, but they conflate it with data retention, which basically means we get it back when they're done with it.</p>\n<p>They're also both super happy to cut third-party developers out of the data chain and call that improved privacy. So far, though, only Apple seems to be super happy cutting even themselves out.</p>\n<p>Take the new Apple Maps, for example. They have to know your location to give you directions and to crowdsource traffic data, but they segment out your route, throw away the start and end points so they don't know where you're coming from and where you're going, and then randomly capture only a few of the segments in between.</p>\n<p>Even their screw up with Siri voice grading they're using as an opportunity to make the system more private.</p>\n<p>If you're worried that means services are worse, you still have the choice of using Google's instead. Including Maps and Assistant. But if you're worried the services are too good, and not in a why that benefits you, you have the option of truly privacy-centric alternatives.</p>\n<h2>4. The camera</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/why-people-are-and-arent-switching-android-iphone-2019\" title=\"Why people are \u2014\u00a0and aren't! \u2014 switching from Android to iPhone in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/night-mode-showdown-rene-iphone-11-pixel-3.jpg?itok=pvdC7B8W\"></a></p>\n<p>One of the few apps Google doesn't make available for anyone else, including even other Android phones, is the Camera app for the Google Pixel phone.</p>\n<p>Yeah, even Google's generosity and openness, it seems, only goes so far.</p>\n<p>And, the Pixel camera app is phenomenal. In an age where some companies are slapping 40-megapixel cameras, or 5 or more cameras, on the back of some phones, more often than not, Google can beat them with just mediocre hardware but simply the best algorithms in the business.</p>\n<p>Apple doesn't do 40 megapixels binning and most people probably wouldn't consider their machine learning to be on the same level as Google's.</p>\n<p>But, they take really, really, good 12-megapixel cameras and they use the world's best silicon to apply really, really good machine learning to them, and they end up coming up with something that even Pixel aficionados are currently calling the best cameras in the world.</p>\n<p>That will go up and down over the course of the next year, I'm sure, but if the camera is your biggest deal-breaker, it's been dealt with.</p>\n<p>When you factor in everything from how fast it launches to how well the customs storage controller ensures not a burst, not a frame is dropped, and the industry-leading 60fps extended dynamic range 4K video and stereo audio capabilities, any camera stress you may feel will likely evaporate just a few shutters or record clicks in.</p>\n<h2>5. The ecosystem</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/why-people-are-and-arent-switching-android-iphone-2019\" title=\"Why people are \u2014\u00a0and aren't! \u2014 switching from Android to iPhone in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/apple-arcade-iphone-xs-max-hero.jpg?itok=lG6HQN81\"></a></p>\n<p>The Apple ecosystem is almost a cliche by now. But, it's that way for a reason.</p>\n<p>You can go to a physical Apple Store and buy an iPhone and the staff there will help you set it up, including transferring your data from your old phone, even Android phone, to your new iPhone.</p>\n<p>You can get everything from AirPods there to an Apple Watch, which is pretty much the best wearable in the business right now. You can also take free classes on photography, video, music, design, development, and more, to get as much out of your new devices as you possibly can.</p>\n<p>You can use iMessage and FaceTime for end-to-end encrypted text and audio/video chat. They're not cross-platform, which is a bummer, but they work great. And, if you need cross-platform, you can get everything from Facebook Messenger to Facebook WhatsApp to Google Duo to Microsoft Skype, to Signal and Discord instead or as well.</p>\n<p>You'll also get software updates, for every region, on every carrier, all the time, at the same time, for years. If you're the type of person who tries to be the 5% on the latest version of Android every year, you can just relax and be the 80 or 90% on the latest version</p>\n<p>And, if you already have an iPad or a Mac, Continuity lets you share cellular data, copy and paste clipboards, and even the exact place you're in apps between devices, and AirDrop lets you send files back and forth so quickly and easily you literally start feeling lost with it.</p>\n<p>Because Apple makes their stuff work so well together, you gain a little serenity and a lot of productivity.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector\">VECTOR | Rene Ritchie</a></h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/+lastest?list=PLOPlnaz0lJJhMap8KV2MeziTUwFkSls0A\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul><li>Video: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/vectorshow\">YouTube</a></li>\n<li>Podcast: <a href=\"http://applepodcasts.com/vector\">Apple</a> | <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1313368831/vector\">Overcast</a> | <a href=\"http://pca.st/vector\">Pocket Casts</a> | <a href=\"http://vector.libsyn.com/rss\">RSS</a></li>\n<li>Column: <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector\">iMore</a> | <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector/rss\">RSS</a></li>\n<li>Social: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reneritchie\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://instagram.com/reneritchie\">Instagram</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><h3>Get More iPhone</h3>\n<h4>Apple iPhone</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/why-people-are-and-arent-switching-android-iphone-2019\" title=\"Why people are \u2014\u00a0and aren't! \u2014 switching from Android to iPhone in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/iphone-11-pro-max-midnight-green-select-2019.png\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F159229%2F554233%2F7613%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUtUiphoneYYr%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fiphone-11-pro%252F&token=EOEZ-EBc\" title=\"\">iPhone 11 Pro From $999 at Apple</a>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F159229%2F554233%2F7613%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUtUiphoneYYr%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fshop%252Fbuy-iphone%252Fiphone-11&token=KuSQWdvR\" title=\"\">iPhone 11 from $699 at Apple</a></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pro-review\" title=\"\">iPhone 11 Pro review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-review\">iPhone 11 review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-iphone-11-pro-cases\">Best Cases for iPhone 11 Pro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-iphone-11-pro-max-cases\">Best Cases for iPhone 11 Pro Max</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-iphone-11-cases\">Best Cases for iPhone 11</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-iphone-11-pro-screen-protectors\">Best Screen Protectors for iPhone 11 Pro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-iphone-11-pro-max-screen-protectors\">Best Screen Protectors for iPhone 11 Pro Max</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-iphone-11-screen-protectors\">Best Screen Protectors for iPhone 11</a> </li>\n</ul></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/TLPrQvRlrnw\" height=\"1\">",

Everything is organic. Gluten-free recipes come with the approval of the Gluten Intolerance Group, and Green Chef is the only meal kit with such designation. Keto fans can find Keto plans; vegans can eat without remorse. While competitors fight with lower prices and celebrity food partnerships, Green Chef is the best service to find a menu that caters to a highly-specialized, restrictive diet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-keto-option_0.jpg?itok=bsuqcfU2\"></a></p>\n<p>I've been using a variety of meal kit services for the last 5 years and I was excited to try the all-organic Green Chef menu. I expected a focus on fresh produce to show off the organic label, as well as a nice variety of impressive menu options befitting the higher price. After all, a Green Chef box for a week of recipes can cost about $20 more than a box from a lower-priced competitor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I expected a focus on fresh produce to show off the organic label</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I cooked three weeks' worth of recipes across the spectrum of Green Chef offerings. I cooked Keto and Paleo recipes, gluten-free and vegan recipes, as well as every protein Green Chef offers and two cuts of fresh fish. I cooked nine meals with two servings each, and I tried to stretch a few meals to feed drop-in guests where I could.</p>\n<h2>What I Like</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-japanese-fritters-plated.jpg?itok=LrGU5QbX\"></a></p>\n<p>Meal Kits got me back into the kitchen after I transitioned from Freewheeling Bohemian to Adult-With-Responsibilities, but cooking lavish meals three times a week comes with a price, and that price is calories, salt, and fat. Meal kits ask for a dollop of oil and a sprinkling of salt with every step, and calorie counts reach four-figures often. Green Chef doesn't even brag about its low-calorie options, which is too bad because it offers an astonishing array of dishes that are 400-500 calories per serving across every menu, not just the low-carb Keto and Paleo plans. The recipes don't recommend excessive amounts of extra salt or require sugary sauces, either.</p>\n<p>I don't usually order fish with my meal kits because my palate is sensitive to aging seafood's funk. I tried barramundi and sole recipes, and I waited a few days before I cooked them just to test the fish's freshness. In both cases, I was delighted with the results: light, flaky filets with no funkiness at all. I'll definitely be going back for more, probably branching into shrimp and salmon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-sole-plated.jpg?itok=Vou57x12\"></a></p>\n<p>While I'll take issue below with some of Green Chef's shortcuts, I appreciate that recipes were snappy to prepare and usually took less time than Green Chef proscribed, a rarity among meal kits. Other services will promise 35 minutes for a meal that needs an hour or more, but most Green Chef meals could easily reach the table within 30-40 minutes flat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I love the dedication to specialized diet needs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, I love the dedication to specialized diet needs that Green Chef takes so seriously. The Gluten Intolerance Group hasn't bothered to certify any meal kits after Green Chef, so for some, this is the only meal kit option. Vegan and vegetarian eaters get individual respect, and vegans can filter for recipes that omit animal products completely. If you're keeping a ketogenic diet, the Green Chef Keto plan is one of the only meal kits that restricts carbs so completely, but the food is tasty and satisfying enough to order even if you usually frequent the Balanced Living menu.</p>\n<h2>What Needs to Improve</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-kale.jpg?itok=RsIlLy7C\"></a></p>\n<p>Green Chef has the specialization aspects down cold, but the 'meal kit' part of the meal kit service needs to improve significantly. If Green Chef weren't organic, with so many options for gluten-free, Keto, vegans, low-calorie dieters, etc., I would have rated them lower on the weakness of the recipes and ingredients alone. The service gets a better grade because of all of its extra credit work, which is still a respectable way to win.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-bibimbap-ingredients.jpg?itok=-9SSWRrN\"></a></p>\n<p>For an organic service with &quot;Green&quot; in the name, I expected more ... green? I wanted an array of fresh and seasonal vegetables. Instead, I mostly got peppers, onions, and scallions. Rather, I got part of a pepper, a bag of chopped onions, and a scallion. I don't mind Green Chef being strict on portions, but sending a pre-cut green pepper, with a slime coating from oxidizing on the journey, is very unappealing. So are sweaty onions in a bag. So is wilted kale, or browning cabbage with &quot;rainbow&quot; carrots. The ingredients tasted fine, but they were on the far edge of fresh and some wouldn't last a whole week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-cabbage-mix.jpg?itok=oYCxXoui\"></a></p>\n<p>Equally unappealing was squeezing out sriracha aioli from a plastic bag on top of my bibimbap. Or squeezing lemon-pepper dressing out of a bag onto my salad. Or squeezing a glop of chopped, roasted red peppers into my pan of vegetables. Too many recipes ask you to cook the meat and veg, then dump whatever sauce or seasoning was provided, no more effort from you.</p>\n<h2>Ask What You Should Do For Your Meal Kit</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-sole-ingredients.jpg?itok=tQrmM8SX\"></a></p>\n<p>The cooking styles were also bland. Meat is seared, or rubbed then seared. Vegetables are sauteed. A promising flatbread arrived with two naan in a bag, a far stretch from the raw dough that Blue Apron will send. Perhaps Green Fresh is aiming for cooks who want to do less cooking, but I would have liked a bit more creativity, and more of a challenge. I don't mind putting in more effort for a meal if it pays off in the eating.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-carrots.jpg?itok=-ixEEQLW\"></a></p>\n<p>A meal kit should require I chop my own vegetables because the sacrifice in freshness of pre-chopped vegetables is not worth the convenience. A meal kit should teach me to make my own sauces and salad dressings because it's easy and good technique and tastes vastly better than the plastic packet. A meal kit should have me roast my own red peppers because that is crazy delicious and makes my house smell like roasted red peppers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A meal kit should require I chop my own vegetables</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A great meal kit service that charges more than all the others should do all of that and more with great recipes that are unique and varied and fun. Green Chef gets the technical award for being the only service to offer recipes to eaters who need serious restriction, but misses the artistic award for lack of inspiration.</p>\n<h2>Should You Buy It?</h2>\n<p> </p><div>\n<span>4</span>\n<span>out of 5</span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </div>\n<p>If you suffer from Celiac Disease, absolutely. If you need to eat low-carb to remain in ketosis for your Keto diet, definitely. If those don't apply to you, maybe not. Passionate organic-only eaters and Paleo fans may enjoy the comparatively large selection, but other services like Sun Basket also offer organic ingredients and a Paleo plan. Meat and fish were exceptionally fresh, so protein-forward folks will appreciate the menu, but if you want real variety in the recipes and concepts you should look elsewhere.</p>\n<p>I would keep subscribing to Green Fresh for it's low-calorie options. There are other services that aim for low-cal eaters, but I like that Green Fresh just keeps its normal recipes at a reasonable calorie level without sacrificing flavors. Still, it is an expensive option if low-calorie is my only priority, so I'd also try other services before I commit long term.</p>\n<div><div>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-bibimbap-plated.jpg?itok=5EFr6Ker\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-bibimbap-plated.jpg?itok=5EFr6Ker\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-falafel-plated.jpg?itok=MIdPkBBt\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-falafel-plated.jpg?itok=MIdPkBBt\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-flatbreads-cooked.jpg?itok=3bfavyUn\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-flatbreads-cooked.jpg?itok=3bfavyUn\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-japanese-fritters-plated.jpg?itok=LrGU5QbX\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-japanese-fritters-plated.jpg?itok=LrGU5QbX\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-sole-plated.jpg?itok=Vou57x12\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/green-chef-meal-kit-review-specialty-diets-welcome\" title=\"Green Chef Meal Kit review: Specialty diets welcome\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/09/green-chef-sole-plated.jpg?itok=Vou57x12\"></a></div> </div></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/C91rCBe6MBk\" height=\"1\">",

According to the planning director for these games, HMs don't facilitate the level of freedom they want players to experience in Gen 8.</p>\n<ul><li>Attack: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Sword-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07PC7X38X?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58051YYr\" title=\"\">Pok\u00e9mon Sword</a> ($60 at Amazon)</li>\n<li>Defend: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Sword-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07P5TL4SH?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58051YYr\" title=\"\">Pok\u00e9mon Shield</a> ($60 at Amazon)</li>\n</ul><h3>What is an HM, and why aren't they in Gen 8?</h3>\n<p>Hidden Machines or HMs have been a part of Pok\u00e9mon games from the very beginning. For most of the RPG titles in the series, they were used to teach your Pok\u00e9mon necessary moves like Fly, Cut, or Surf to get to new areas of a map. Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon were the first games to do away with HMs, and according to Kazumasa Iwao, Sword and Shield's planning director, they won't be in Gen 8 either.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I think they played a role in the series traditionally to be like the relationship between a door and a key; the HM will unlock something and you're able to progress and feel the ability to go to a new place. We didn't have them in Sun and Moon, and this time around, we didn't feel it really matched the concept, especially with the Wild Area and wanting to have this higher degree of freedom. The player can choose how they want to engage with the gameplay. Having the more HM-based elements, we didn't feel it really matched the game, so this time around they're not in it.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Game Freak has been making several changes to the Pok\u00e9mon formula when it comes to Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield. Given that, it's not too surprising that HMs won't be involved.</p>\n<h3>Game mechanics that act similar to HMs</h3>\n<p>We've already seen that Corviknights function as flying taxis in Gen 8, which likely takes the place of the HM Fly, and we've also noticed that trainers will have bikes that can traverse water, so that takes the place of Surf. Overall, I think this change will make the game feel more open and less formulaic than previous titles.</p>\n<p>Since HMs have been done away with, I'll be curious to see if players will still be able to cut through bushes, travel up waterfalls, or use a Pok\u00e9mon's strength to move obstacles. I hope at the least that players will be able to use Pok\u00e9mon's moves outside of battle in some form or other. It helps make the world seem more realistic when that happens. I guess we'll have to wait and see what's in store for us when Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield release on November 15, 2019.</p>\n\n<h2>Attack and defend</h2>\n<h3>Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/will-there-be-hms-pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Will there be HMs in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/pokemon-sword-shield.jpg?itok=0pIJgKBo\"></a></p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Sword-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07PC7X38X?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58051YYr\" title=\"\">$60 for Pok\u00e9mon Sword at Amazon</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Sword-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07P5TL4SH?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU58051YYr\" title=\"\">$60 for Pok\u00e9mon Shield at Amazon</a></li>\n</ul><p>Who will you choose?</p>\n<p>Trainers will have the chance to explore a brand new map and come across brand new Pok\u00e9mon as well as familiar fan favorites.

For most of the RPG titles in the series, they were used to teach your Pok\u00e9mon necessary moves like Fly, Cut, or Surf to get to new areas of a map. Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon were the first games to do away with HMs, and according to Kazumasa Iwao, Sword and Shield's planning director, they won't be in Gen 8 either.\n&quot;I think they played a role in the series traditionally to be like the relationship between a door and a key; the HM will unlock something and you're able to progress and feel the ability to go to a new place.

Pairing to Bluetooth was a simple process, though the first time it showed up in the menu it refused to connect. I ended up turning the keyboard off and then back on and it connected instantly. The iPad itself fits very snug inside the hinges, which at first made me a little uncomfortable. There are protective rubber pads to help prevent any damage from taking place, and the bezels on my iPad Air made it a bit easier to line up, but I still felt like I would put too much pressure on the display and potentially damage it.</p>\n<p>Once connected, I immediately started typing and typing away, and for anyone familiar with an Apple keyboard, you'll feel right at home with this one. It offers nice key travel, the keys are large enough and pretty well spaced, but I did notice that some of the keys, like the delete, enter, and shift key felt a bit too small for my big fingers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/brydge-ii-ipad-air-keyboard-review\" title=\"Brydge Series II Keyboard for iPad Air review: Productivity levels keep increasing\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/brydge-keyboard-backlit.jpg?itok=TWM2NDYn\"></a></p>\n<p>Having backlit keys has quickly turned into something that I find myself needing more and more. There are plenty of times that I'm working early in the morning, or late into the evening, so having the keys lit up makes it much easier to type. There are three levels of brightness that you can easily change between with a single tap on the keyboard. Speaking of shortcuts, there is a whole row of keys at the top which make things like accessing the home screen, multitasking, volume and brightness control, and more so much easier.</p>\n<p>The industrial style design of the keyboard feels great in the hand, and the pads on the bottom of it help keep it in place on your desk without any troubles. One of my favorite things is that the hinge design allows for it to be used in a ton of different angle positions, like your laptop, which is great so you can move it slightly if you need to get rid of some glare or reflection.</p>\n<p>Brydge says that the battery should last for about a year on a single charge, and while I haven't had it long enough to confirm that, I did notice that in the last few weeks of typing on the keyboard for various increments of time that I've only lost a few percent of the battery life. The long-lasting battery means that you can keep it attached to your iPad and take it with you everywhere without any worries that it won't be ready to type your next essay or email when you are.</p>\n<p>One big perk of this keyboard over some of the others that I have used in the past was that the battery level integrates with the Batteries Widget, which allows you to see how much charge is left at a glance. There is also an on-keyboard battery indicator but it's much easier for me to be able to see the number on the screen and know whether I need to charge it or not without any guess work.</p>\n<h2>Brydge II iPad Air Keyboard <em>What I don't like</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/brydge-ii-ipad-air-keyboard-review\" title=\"Brydge Series II Keyboard for iPad Air review: Productivity levels keep increasing\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blb/public/field/image/2019/09/brydge-keyboard-charging-port.jpg?itok=YnRtVlb_\"></a></p>\n<p>There's so much to like about this keyboard that at first I thought it was the <em>only</em> one in existence that even mattered. After getting settled into the keyboard, though, and using it for a few weeks, some things started to bother me. There are a couple minor annoyances, but sometimes the addition of minor issues can ruin the overall experience.</p>\n<p>The biggest complaint that I have with this keyboard is the random missed keystrokes. I type on the fast side, but I've never had an issue typing on any other iPad keyboard that missed multiple strokes. A quick search showed that I was not the only one who experienced this. It's not limited to any particular single key or set of keys either, which actually makes it even more annoying because you don't know whether what you're typing will give you an issue or not.</p>\n<p>Second, the charging port is still micro-USB. It's not a huge thing since the battery life seems to last what feels like forever. Brydge says it should last on average about a year per charge, but your usage habits will affect that. A micro-USB cable is included in the box, but since so few things use it these days there's nothing that says finding it again in a year will be easy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/brydge-ii-ipad-air-keyboard-review\" title=\"Brydge Series II Keyboard for iPad Air review: Productivity levels keep increasing\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/brydge-keyboard-hinge.jpg?itok=KO4paR6E\"></a></p>\n<p>The hinge design of the keyboard is very sturdy, but because it makes the screen of the iPad sit nearly flush with the keys, I could no longer use some of my swipe gestures on the iPad. I prefer to swipe up to get the dock, or up and to the right to get to multitasking, and those are just impossible with the positioning. You can use the built-in keyboard shortcut to circumvent this, but depending how much muscle memory you have around the gestures it may be a bit of a pain for you as well. Since the hinge fits over the iPad itself very tight it does make it a bit hard to get in and out, and Brydge recommends you lift it straight up instead of at an angle. This makes it a two hand job, and docking it is much the same.</p>\n<p>Brydge sells a back cover to add some protection to your iPad while out and about or traveling, which is great, but unfortunately it doesn't have any where to store your Apple Pencil. I use my Pencil daily for notes and annotations, so I love having it readily accessible. I wish Brydge would add a slot to the back cover, or even sell a little accessory that would allow you to secure the Pencil to the back.</p>\n<h2>Brydge II iPad Air Keyboard <em>Should you buy it?</em></h2>\n<p>If you want your iPad to look and feel like a MacBook, this is the case for you. From the design to the feel of the keys, everything will make you feel right at home, right down to the missed key presses. The keyboard does not add any protection to your iPad, though, but neither does Apple's own Smart Keyboard and several other options</p>\n<p> </p><div>\n<span>3.5</span>\n<span>out of 5</span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </div>\n<p>While the Brydge II keyboard looks and feels great, at the current price (plus the additional cost of a case to cover the back of your iPad, it's hard to say that this is the best option for most people. There are features that other keyboards do better, like multicolor backlighting, multiple Bluetooth connections, etc, so be sure to weigh all your options and look for one of these on sale if you can afford to wait a little for it.</p>\n\n<h3>Type in style</h3>\n<h3>Brydge II iPad Air Keyboard</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/brydge-ii-ipad-air-keyboard-review\" title=\"Brydge Series II Keyboard for iPad Air review: Productivity levels keep increasing\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/815h7rfedal._ac_sx679_.jpg?itok=Wy7CIt3e\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-10-5-Keyboard-Bluetooth-Silver/dp/B07HXH6NWN/?mnsid=mbnx3-20&tag=mbnx33-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57619YYr\" title=\"\">$120 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </span>\n</p>\n<p>Feature loaded and sleek.</p>\n<p>It may not make your iPad into a MacBook, but it sure does make it look like one.

Our vision was bold, and we never wavered on what we were trying to accomplish, and why. We wanted to do something for the millions of people who struggled to fall asleep, and stay asleep.</p>\n<p>We knew our solution was so technically complex, we'd have to make major investments, source special components, and engineer multiple breakthroughs. We knew we were attempting to do something that had never been done before. But there was no doubt in our minds \u2014 it would be worth it. Because we wanted to help you. We still do. We always will. And for many of you, we have. You've told us that sleepbuds\u2122 have allowed you to get your first good night's rest in years, and that you can't imagine ending the day without them.</p>\n<p>But some of you have had a far different experience.</p>\n<p>You've reported issues with your sleepbuds\u2122 not charging fully, powering down unexpectedly, or both. And you've let us know. We've heard you. We've read your posts. We've documented your calls. We've torn down returned products you've sent us, and replaced them with new ones, sometimes more than once. We've also relentlessly researched the root cause with a team dedicated to nothing else. Based on what we knew, we believed that software and firmware updates could fix the issues. But the failures have continued, and recently, they've increased. That led us to look more closely at each piece of hardware. And we learned that while the battery we chose functions safely, it doesn't work as consistently or predictably as it should to meet our standards.</p>\n<p>For that reason, we're discontinuing sleepbuds\u2122. We'll go back to research, because we are committed to making our vision a reality. But today, we begin with something more important \u2013 doing whatever it takes to make things right with you.</p>\n<p>As always, we will stand behind our products and honor our sleepbuds\u2122 warranty. We're also extending an offer to all our sleepbuds\u2122 customers: You can return your product for a full refund until December 31, 2019. Please visit http://worldwide.bose.com/support/sleepbuds for more information or https://worldwide.bose.com/contact to find contact information for service agents in your region.</p>\n<p>Finally, for more than 50 years, we've conducted extensive research to do things that no one ever thought possible. Each time, we did it to make your life better. When we've challenged convention, we haven't always succeeded. Sometimes we've stumbled. Sometimes, despite our diligence, things have gone wrong. And by far, our worst days are when that's impacted you. Nothing else comes close.</p>\n<p>We're sorry for disappointing you, and we're sorry for not communicating more clearly along the way. We had good intentions, but unless that makes a difference to you, it's not enough.</p>\n<p>We're ready to hear from you.</p>\n<p>And we're going to stay right here for as long as you need.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>John Roselli\nGeneral Manager\nBose Corp</p>\n</blockquote></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/RawAH1opDAY\" height=\"1\">",

The main reason was constant issues with the battery that didn't &quot;work as consistently or predictably as it should to meet our standards.&quot;\nWe reviewed Bose's Sleepbuds earlier this year and came away impressed with them.

These are throwbacks\nto the rumored Courier booklet and the more recent Andromeda fever\ndreams of Panos Panay come to life. But they\u2019re also mini Surfaces\ndesigned to catapult Microsoft back into mobile. Even so, they\u2019re\nnot expected to ship until the holiday season of 2020. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>In fact, the most recent version of the Duo doesn\u2019t have a\nrear-facing camera. The way it\u2019s currently designed, taking a\npicture would require the person using it to open the Duo, unlock\nthe Duo, and flip its front-facing camera to the back of the\ndevice. I question this, more than once. Panay says it\u2019s still\nearly days, that the camera may change, that he\u2019s nervous to\nreveal this so far in advance because it exposes the design to\ncompetitors.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are our efforts for the past two and a half years, so\nthere\u2019s a balance to the number of details I can give, even with\nregards to the camera,\u201d he tells me. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>Panay says he didn\u2019t think about making a single-screened phone,\nand that this dual-screened phone is the antithesis of a\nsingle-screened phone in many ways, because of how much more\nproductive you can be on it. It is so obvious that he loves this\nthing. That he\u2019s been restraining himself from talking about it\npublicly for one, two, nearly three years now. That <em>he</em> feels\nmore productive with it, though it remains to be seen whether\nthere\u2019s a market for dual-screened, cellular-equipped, Android\ndevices running optimized Windows apps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s certainly some original thinking here in both these devices. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date\">various ways the hardware keyboard can attach to the larger one</a>, the Neo, is pretty clever. But in very typical Microsoft fashion, the Neo and Duo are both just prototypes. They\u2019re over a year from shipping according to the company, the software is so early days that the media weren\u2019t allowed to play with them, there\u2019s no word on pricing, and Panay admits they haven\u2019t even decided fundamental aspects like how many cameras they\u2019ll have.</p>\n<p>And in the meantime, they\u2019ve completely overshadowed the real products Microsoft actually announced yesterday.</p>\n<p>Microsoft started yesterday\u2019s event by banging the drum that they never have and never will compromise on the quality of their laptop keyboards\u2009\u2014\u2009a clear <em>and completely fair</em> competitive dig at Apple. That\u2019s the message they should have left the world with\u2009\u2014\u2009that they, not Apple\u2009\u2014\u2009now make the best laptop hardware in the world. Instead, they left everyone talking about two products that won\u2019t be out for another year.</p>\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Lauren Goode on Microsoft\u2019s Surface Duo and Neo\u2019\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/03/goode-panay-surface-duo-and-neo\">\u00a0\u2605\u00a0</a>\n</div>"

I say this because it has four card slots that stretch to fit up to eight (that's right, eight) cards, one of them being a window slot for your ID, plus a stack of cash. Most wallet cases support 4 cards. Some don't have a space to carry cash at all and you end up shoving a couple of bills into one of the spare card slots.</p>\n<p>The entire case measures in at 6&quot; x 3 3/8&quot; x 0.55&quot;, which is not a slim case by any means. It sort of reminds me of a woman's style clutch wallet (only not that big). It adds a bit of extra size around the length and width of the iPhone, plus fairly significant depth, depending on how many cards you put in it.</p>\n<p>The hardshell case that snaps the iPhone 11 Pro into place protects from scratches and can be a glass-saving feature if you drop your iPhone (it's not drop-protected graded or anything, but it's better than nothing). It's a simple black hardshell case that is actually removable. It is stuck to the leather folio with a standard 3M adhesive.</p>\n<p>The hardshell case by itself is velvety smooth to the touch, even though it's just made out of polycarbonate. The top, bottom, and side buttons are exposed for easy access to everyting you need.</p>\n<p>This year's Bella Fino is upgraded from last year with one feature that a lot of people are really going to love:</p>\n<p>The one complaint iMore case reviewer Karen Freeman had with <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pad-quill-bella-fino-iphone-case-review-gorgeous-flawed\">last year's Bella Fino</a> is that the case didn't lay flat when filled with cards. Though a long enough &quot;breaking in&quot; period usually fixes that, it can be a bother for some. This year, Pad &amp; Quill added a handy <em>removable</em> elastic strap (in stylish colors) so you can keep that wallet completely closed up until it breaks in. Then, if you so choose, remove the elastic and go free, or keep the elastic on if you prefer the look.</p>\n<p>The case is available in three different exterior colors, each with one or two interior color options.</p>\n<ul><li>Chocolate and Deep Sea Blue</li>\n<li>Galloper Black and Plum</li>\n<li>Galloper Black and Slate Gray</li>\n<li>Whiskey and Deep Sea Blue</li>\n<li>Whiskey and Forest Green</li>\n</ul><p>They all come with either a black or brown elastic strap, but for $10 more, you can add a three-pack color option with light blue, yellow, and orange. If you want to add even more elastic straps to your style, you can pick from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D695070%26m%3D54540%26U%3D885495%26afftrack%3DUUimUdUnU57673YYr%26urllink%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.padandquill.com%252Fextra-elastic-strap.html&token=Q3FC7kRu\" title=\"\">eight different colors</a> at $10 each.</p>\n<p>When you want to remove the elastic strap, pull the hardshell interior case from the leather folio to expose the elastic strap clips. You can take these off and put them on any time at your preference.</p>\n<h4>All-in-one</h4>\n<h2>Bella Fino wallet case for iPhone 11 Pro: What I like</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pad-quill-bella-fino-iphone-11-pro-case-review-only-wallet-case-youll-ever-need\" title=\"Pad &amp; Quill Bella Fino iPhone 11 Pro case review: The only wallet case you'll ever need\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/bella-fino-iphone-11-pro-case-review-02.jpeg?itok=mc5DD4TA\"></a></p>\n<p>As far as wallet cases go, the Bella Fino is the premier case by which all other cases should be compared. It is beautifully stitched American full-grain leather with an attractive etched Pad &amp; Quill logo on the binding. The complimentary interior leather tint brings an extra beauty to the overall look.</p>\n<p>I'd used the Bella Fino with my iPhone XS when I traveled for the past year and always found it to be so much more convenient than having a case and wallet separate. Because it is big enough to hold as many as eight cards, I don't feel like I have to bring anything else with me than this case. Right now, I have six cards in my Bella Fino and don't even have more cards that I feel I need to add to it.</p>\n<p>Cash fits nicely, folded in half, into the large-for-a-wallet-case cash slot. You can't keep your dollar bills unfolded, but it's darn close.</p>\n<p>I love that Pad &amp; Quill added an elastic strap to the Bella Fino. Though my case didn't take long to break in and lay flat, it was somewhat annoying for the first month or so, trying to get that binding to soften up. With the elastic strap, the case stays closed.</p>\n<p>Though I never find my self needing to do this, I <em>do</em> like that I have the option to pull the hardshell case off the leather folio and just go with a minimal protective case. It's by no means pretty \u2014 it's just a simple black case \u2014 but it feels nice to the touch.</p>\n<h4>Too much wallet?</h4>\n<h2>Bella Fino wallet case for iPhone 11 Pro: What I don't like</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pad-quill-bella-fino-iphone-11-pro-case-review-only-wallet-case-youll-ever-need\" title=\"Pad &amp; Quill Bella Fino iPhone 11 Pro case review: The only wallet case you'll ever need\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/bella-fino-iphone-11-pro-case-review-07.jpeg?itok=ZR2Q4h87\"></a></p>\n<p>The Bella Fino is a big case. Make no mistake, this isn't a minimal, slip-it-in-your-back-pocket design. In fact, it probably won't fit into some back pockets. It adds a lot of depth to your iPhone 11 Pro (nearly twice as thick as without a case), though it only extends around the height and length a few centimeters.</p>\n<p>This luxury wallet case is designed for men and women that prefer to keep their iPhone inside a purse or bag (probably a luxury leather one). If you are looking for a slim simple wallet case, you may want to <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-iphone-11-pro-cases\">look elsewhere</a>.</p>\n<p>Though I'm in love with the new elastic strap, especially the colorful options, it tends to get in the way of such things as wireless charging and taking pictures.</p>\n<p>Some charging pads are robust enough to make it through the additional thickness of the elastic strap, but it can be finicky. I found myself taking my iPhone out of the case before settling in for the night because I'd struggled to find the sweet spot for wireless charging.</p>\n<p>If you aren't careful, the dangling wireless strap will fall in front of the back-facing camera, getting in the way of that impromptu shot. With just a bit of memory training, however, I remembered to always hold the strap away from the lens, thus avoiding obstruction.</p>\n<h4>Bottomline</h4>\n<h2>Bella Fino wallet case for iPhone 11 Pro: Conclusion</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pad-quill-bella-fino-iphone-11-pro-case-review-only-wallet-case-youll-ever-need\" title=\"Pad &amp; Quill Bella Fino iPhone 11 Pro case review: The only wallet case you'll ever need\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/bella-fino-iphone-11-pro-case-review-05.jpeg?itok=eYZrR7Kx\"></a></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </span>\n</p>\n<p>If you're a wallet case kind of person, and you know who you are, the Bella Fino ticks <em>all</em> the boxes. With four card slots to hold up to eight cards, plus a cash slot, you can leave your wallet at home and replace it with this all-in-one wallet case.</p>\n<p>It's big, though. Do you usually protect your iPhone 11 Pro with a thin case? Do you wear tight jeans and keep your iPhone in your back pocket? The Bella Fino may not fit your style.</p>\n<p>Personally, I don't use my Bella Fino every day. I use an ultra-thin clear case (because I like to be as pure as possible while protecting my iPhone). I switch to it whenever I travel. The wallet/case combo helps me pack less while making things much more convenient for me.</p>\n<h3>More wallet than case</h3>\n<h4>Bella Fino wallet case for iPhone 11 Pro</h4>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pad-quill-bella-fino-iphone-11-pro-case-review-only-wallet-case-youll-ever-need\" title=\"Pad &amp; Quill Bella Fino iPhone 11 Pro case review: The only wallet case you'll ever need\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/bella-fino-cropped.jpg?itok=LJxShY7W\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D695070%26m%3D54540%26U%3D885495%26afftrack%3DUUimUdUnU57673YYr%26urllink%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.padandquill.com%252Fbella-fino-leather-iphone-11-pro-case.html&token=LO7dFc0q\" title=\"\">$80 at Pad &amp; Quill</a></p>\n<p>For people who want a wallet/case combo.</p>\n<p>If you want to ditch having a separate wallet, but need room for all your cards and cash, the Bella Fino is more wallet than case.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/AKy6dys0_Ek\" height=\"1\">",

                "content": "<p>Okay, obviously many SQL queries do start with <code>SELECT</code> (and actually this post is only about <code>SELECT</code> queries, not <code>INSERT</code>s or anything).</p>\n<p>But! Yesterday I was working on an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1179419244808851462?s=20\">explanation of window\nfunctions</a>, and I\nfound myself googling \u201ccan you filter based on the result of a window\nfunction\u201d. As in \u2013 can you filter the result of a window function in\na WHERE or HAVING or something?</p>\n<p>Eventually I concluded \u201cwindow functions must run after WHERE and GROUP BY\nhappen, so you can\u2019t do it\u201d. But this led me to a bigger question \u2013 <strong>what\norder do SQL queries actually run in?</strong>.</p>\n<p>This was something that I felt like I knew intuitively (\u201cI\u2019ve written at least\n10,000 SQL queries, some of them were really complicated! I must know this!\u201c)\nbut I struggled to actually articulate what the order was.</p>\n<h3>SQL queries happen in this order</h3>\n<p>I looked up the order, and here it is! (SELECT isn\u2019t the first thing, it\u2019s like the 5th thing!) (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1179449535938076673\">here it is in a tweet</a>).</p>\n<p><small>\n(I really want to find a more accurate way of phrasing this than \u201csql queries\nhappen/run in this order\u201d but I haven\u2019t figured it out yet)\n</small></p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://jvns.ca/images/sql-queries.jpeg\"><img width=\"400px\" src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/sql-queries.jpeg\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>In a non-image format, the order is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>FROM/JOIN</code> and all the <code>ON</code> conditions</li>\n<li><code>WHERE</code></li>\n<li><code>GROUP BY</code></li>\n<li><code>HAVING</code></li>\n<li><code>SELECT</code> (including window functions)</li>\n<li><code>ORDER BY</code></li>\n<li><code>LIMIT</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>questions this diagram helps you answer</h3>\n<p>This diagram is about the <em>semantics</em> of SQL queries \u2013 it lets you reason through what a given query will return and answers questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can I do <code>WHERE</code> on something that came from a <code>GROUP BY</code>? (no! WHERE happens before GROUP BY!)</li>\n<li>Can I filter based on the results of a window function? (no! window functions happen in <code>SELECT</code>, which happens after both <code>WHERE</code> and <code>GROUP BY</code>)</li>\n<li>Can I <code>ORDER BY</code> based on something I did in GROUP BY? (yes! <code>ORDER BY</code> is basically the last thing, you can <code>ORDER BY</code> based on anything!)</li>\n<li>When does <code>LIMIT</code> happen? (at the very end!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Database engines don\u2019t actually literally run queries in this order</strong> because they\nimplement a bunch of optimizations to make queries run faster \u2013 we\u2019ll get to\nthat a little later in the post.</p>\n<p>So:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can use this diagram when you just want to understand which queries are valid and how to reason about what results of a given query will be</li>\n<li>you <em>shouldn\u2019t</em> use this diagram to reason about query performance or anything involving indexes, that\u2019s a much more complicated thing with a lot more variables</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>confounding factor: column aliases</h3>\n<p>Someone on Twitter pointed out that many SQL implementations let you use the syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, count(*)\nFROM table\nGROUP BY full_name\n</code></pre>\n<p>This query makes it <em>look</em> like GROUP BY happens after SELECT even though GROUP BY is first, because the\nGROUP BY references an alias from the SELECT. But it\u2019s not actually necessary\nfor the GROUP BY to run after the SELECT for this to work \u2013 the database engine can\njust rewrite the query as</p>\n<pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, count(*)\nFROM table\nGROUP BY CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and run the GROUP BY first.</p>\n<p>Your database engine also definitely does a bunch of checks to make sure that what you\nput in SELECT and GROUP BY makes sense together before it even starts to run\nthe query, so it has to look at the query as a whole anyway before it starts to\ncome up with an execution plan.</p>\n<h3>queries aren\u2019t actually run in this order (optimizations!)</h3>\n<p>Database engines in practice don\u2019t actually run queries by joining, and then\nfiltering, and then grouping, because they implement a bunch of optimizations\nreorder things to make the query run faster as long as reordering things won\u2019t\nchange the results of the query.</p>\n<p>One simple example of a reason why need to run queries in a different order to\nmake them fast is that in this query:</p>\n<pre><code>SELECT * FROM\nowners LEFT JOIN cats ON owners.id = cats.owner\nWHERE cats.name = 'mr darcy'\n</code></pre>\n<p>it would be silly to do the whole left join and match up all the rows in the 2\ntables if you just need to look up the 3 cats named \u2018mr darcy\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s way\nfaster to do some filtering first for cats named \u2018mr darcy\u2019. And in this case\nfiltering first doesn\u2019t change the results of the query!</p>\n<p>There are lots of other optimizations that database engines implement in\npractice that might make them run queries in a different order but there\u2019s no\nroom for that and honestly it\u2019s not something I\u2019m an expert on.</p>\n<h3>LINQ starts queries with <code>FROM</code></h3>\n<p>LINQ (a querying syntax in C# and VB.NET) uses the order <code>FROM ... WHERE ... SELECT</code>. Here\u2019s an example of a LINQ query:</p>\n<pre><code>var teenAgerStudent = from s in studentList\n                      where s.Age > 12 &amp;&amp; s.Age &lt; 20\n                      select s;\n</code></pre>\n<p>pandas (my <a href=\"https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook\">favourite data wrangling\ntool</a>) also basically works like this,\nthough you don\u2019t need to use this exact order \u2013 I\u2019ll often write pandas code\nlike this:</p>\n<pre><code>df = thing1.join(thing2)      # like a JOIN\ndf = df[df.created_at > 1000] # like a WHERE\ndf = df.groupby('something', num_yes = ('yes', 'sum')) # like a GROUP BY\ndf = df[df.num_yes > 2]       # like a HAVING, filtering on the result of a GROUP BY\ndf = df[['num_yes', 'something1', 'something']] # pick the columns I want to display, like a SELECT\ndf.sort_values('sometthing', ascending=True)[:30] # ORDER BY and LIMIT\ndf[:30]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn\u2019t because pandas is imposing any specific rule on how you have to\nwrite your code, though. It\u2019s just that it often makes sense to write code in\nthe order JOIN / WHERE / GROUP BY / HAVING. (I\u2019ll often put a <code>WHERE</code> first to\nimprove performance though, and I think most database engines will also do a\nWHERE first in practice)</p>\n<p><code>dplyr</code> in R also lets you use a different syntax for querying SQL databases\nlike Postgres, MySQL and SQLite, which is also in a more logical order.</p>\n<h3>I was really surprised that I didn\u2019t know this</h3>\n<p>I\u2019m writing a blog post about this because when I found out the order I was SO\nSURPRISED that I\u2019d never seen it written down that way before \u2013 it explains\nbasically everything that I knew intuitively about why some queries are allowed\nand others aren\u2019t. So I wanted to write it down in the hopes that it will help\nother people also understand how to write SQL queries.</p>"

This is still the only place you can send messages to regular followers, and any ongoing conversations with Close Friends in the Threads app will also show up here.</p>\n<p>Threads looks like a nicely-designed app and could be a huge hit, but right now, I'm a little confused as to what Instagram's long-term plan is here. Between the camera being the home page and direct messages just being a swipe away, Threads is <em>very</em> similar to Snapchat \u2014 sans the public image/video sharing that takes place on the main Instagram app with Stories.</p>\n<p>But, I digress.

While this case does not lend your iPhone (which already has a IP68 water resistance rating) any additional waterproofing, it is wrapped in a hydrophobic leather. This means that unlike most leathers, this special leather is water-resistant so the case itself won't sustain damage if it gets wet. Nomad sources this leather from a German tannery called Heinen, which has been tanning leather since 1891. Heinen leather is infused with natural lipids that should never wear out, unline topical leather sprays. This gives it a different look and feel. While <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-rugged-tri-folio-iphone-case-review\">Nomad's</a> <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-rugged-folio-iphone-case-review\">other cases</a>, wrapped in <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-rugged-iphone-case-review-elegant-protection\">Horween leather</a>, develop a significant patina with use, the Heinen leather of the Active Rugged Case resists scuffs and develops only a slight patina.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the weekend adventurer that also wants a smart, professional-looking case for the office, the Nomad Active Rugged Case fits the bill on both counts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The case is on the slimmer side, but it's still substantive enough. to offer real drop protection. It has a TPU bumper around the edges, a polycarbonate body, and the leather on top. Inside the case is lined is a soft microfiber. This adds up to six-foot drop protection. The entire case is smooth and comfortable in the hand, there aren't bumps or unsightly seams where one material ends and another begins. The texture of the TPU bumper is smooth, but not terribly slippery.</p>\n<p>There is just enough of a lip around the screen and the camera for protection when you set the phone down. Right-sized cutouts for the camera, mute switch, Lightning port, and speakers ensure easy access. TPU button covers over the Sleep/Wake and volume buttons aren't fancy but they work. At the bottom of the phone, there are two lanyard attachment points. No lanyard is included, but you can attach one, either wristlet or necklace style if desired. Wireless charging works just fine with my iPhone in the Nomad Active Rugged Case.</p>\n<p>You won't find any branding on the outside of the case, only NOMAD tastefully engraved into the microfiber interior. Choose from two colors: Black and Mocha.</p>\n<h4>Unique qualities</h4>\n<h2>Nomad Active Rugged Case for iPhone: <em>What I like</em></h2>\n<p>Usual,ly when you're looking for a case that won't get damaged or stained if you sweat on it, get caught in the rain, or go skiing, you're looking for a case made from plastic. But Nomad has come up with an option for leather fans. The Nomad. Active Rugged Case lets you go on your outdoor adventures (or sweaty gym session) without worrying about case damage. I don't think I've seen any other hydrophobic leather iPhone cases on the market.</p>\n<p>I like that the case is fairly slim and allows wireless charging but still offers six-foot drop protection. The dual lanyard attachment points are another nice touch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-active-rugged-case-review-water-resistant-protection\" title=\"Nomad Active Rugged Case review: Water-resistant leather\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-8.jpeg?itok=pZEmc652\"></a></p>\n<h4>Less luxurious aesthetic</h4>\n<h2>Nomad Active Rugged Case for iPhone: <em>What I don't like</em></h2>\n<p>I was showing a friend this case and her first comment was, &quot;This is leather?&quot; It just doesn't have that luxurious leather look and feel you'd expect. It's somehow less ... leathery. It's definitely a trade-off, if you want that water resistance, you're giving up a little in the aesthetics department.</p>\n<h4>Adventurer case</h4>\n<h2>Nomad Active Rugged Case for iPhone: Bottom line</h2>\n<p> </p><div>\n<span>4.5</span>\n<span>out of 5</span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </div>\n<p>For the weekend adventurer that also wants a smart, professional-looking case for the office, the Nomad Active Rugged Case fits the bill on both counts. Since it's wrapped in hydrophobic leather, you don't have to worry about the case sustaining water damage. With its TPU and polycarbonate shell, you get six-foot drop protection. The intererior is thoughtfully lined in microfiber so as to prevent scratches on the iPhone's glass back. The phone is still fully functional within the case, including wireless charging. Dual attachement points on both bottom corners mean you can affix a wristlet or necklace-style lanyard (not included) if you wish.</p>\n<p>The case is sharp-looking and office-appropriate, it looks right in even the most formal settings. However, the specially treated Heinen leather used on this case doesn't have quite the elegant, supple aesthetic that other premium leathers have. The trade-off will be well worth it for your peace of mind.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pntrs.com%2Ft%2F2-150563-122267-119386%3Fwebsite%3D218319%26sid%3DUUimUdUnU58057YYr%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fhellonomad.com%252Fsearch%253Fq%253Dactive%252Brugged%252Bcase&token=OEHs8FCE\" title=\"\">See at Nomad</a></p>\n<div><div>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-3.jpeg?itok=2fBjMsLE\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-active-rugged-case-review-water-resistant-protection\" title=\"Nomad Active Rugged Case review: Water-resistant leather\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-3.jpeg?itok=2fBjMsLE\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-4.jpeg?itok=zE8epBcs\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-active-rugged-case-review-water-resistant-protection\" title=\"Nomad Active Rugged Case review: Water-resistant leather\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-4.jpeg?itok=zE8epBcs\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-5.jpeg?itok=ba1Rtgpf\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-active-rugged-case-review-water-resistant-protection\" title=\"Nomad Active Rugged Case review: Water-resistant leather\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-5.jpeg?itok=ba1Rtgpf\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-6.jpeg?itok=L0VjwK8U\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-active-rugged-case-review-water-resistant-protection\" title=\"Nomad Active Rugged Case review: Water-resistant leather\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-6.jpeg?itok=L0VjwK8U\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-7.jpeg?itok=zScjv8us\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-active-rugged-case-review-water-resistant-protection\" title=\"Nomad Active Rugged Case review: Water-resistant leather\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-7.jpeg?itok=zScjv8us\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-2.jpeg?itok=CMSIfc7H\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-active-rugged-case-review-water-resistant-protection\" title=\"Nomad Active Rugged Case review: Water-resistant leather\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-2.jpeg?itok=CMSIfc7H\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-9.jpeg?itok=lL8-Pnp1\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nomad-active-rugged-case-review-water-resistant-protection\" title=\"Nomad Active Rugged Case review: Water-resistant leather\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/10/nomad-active-rugged-case-iphone-11-pro-9.jpeg?itok=lL8-Pnp1\"></a></div> </div></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/fczH7I1ltEo\" height=\"1\">",

Join Lucky on his adventure to save the Book of Ages from a gang of troublesome cats, gather collectibles like Clovers and Coins, and enjoy brand new story not present in the other versions of the game.</p>\n<p>New Super Lucky's Tale is a complete and updated version of Super Lucky's Tale, which has been out on other platforms for a while now. But Nintendo consoles are natural homes for 3D platformers like this, and with plenty of new story and features, New Super Lucky's Tale on the Switch is a perfect fit. Here's everything you need to know about Lucky and his adventures through the Book of Ages before it launches:</p>\n<h2>What is New Super Lucky's Tale?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/new-super-luckys-tale-everything-you-need-know\" title=\"New Super Lucky's Tale: Everything you need to know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/super-luckys-tale-nintendo-switch-05.jpg?itok=3e0aEfEN\"></a></p>\n<p>New Super Lucky's Tale is a 3D platformer developed by Playful Corp as a sequel to Lucky's Tale on the Oculus Rift. It follows the character of Lucky, a fox, as he tries to stop a nefarious cat named Jinx from stealing and harming the Book of Ages -- a book of living worlds and creatures. The game is reminiscent of classic 3D platformers in that the player, as Lucky, travels to different hub worlds, then use those hubs to access individually-themed levels. Within those levels, players will collect various items, including Clovers, which are the main progression item that allows Lucky to save the Book of Ages.</p>\n<h2>How do I play?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/new-super-luckys-tale-everything-you-need-know\" title=\"New Super Lucky's Tale: Everything you need to know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/super-luckys-tale-nintendo-switch-04.jpg?itok=W5ptUh8x\"></a></p>\n<p>As Lucky the fox, you can run, jump, attack, and burrow underground. Most enemies can be defeated with an attack or a jump from Lucky, though sometimes you may have to get clever with how or where you hit them. Burrowing underground can only be used in certain areas, and it can be used to dig up treasure or access hidden areas.</p>\n<p>Your main goal in each stage is to collect Clovers. Every level has four Clovers to collect -- one for finishing the level the first time, one for collecting 300 coins, one for finding five hidden collectible letters that spell &quot;LUCKY&quot; in each level, and an additional hidden Clover that can be obtained in different ways in each level, often by finding a secret hidden area. You'll need to collect certain amounts of Clovers to progress through the game's levels and worlds.</p>\n<h2>Do I need to have played the original Lucky's Tale?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/new-super-luckys-tale-everything-you-need-know\" title=\"New Super Lucky's Tale: Everything you need to know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/super-luckys-tale-nintendo-switch-03.jpg?itok=pji8my5D\"></a></p>\n<p>Not at all. Lucky's Tale was originally an Oculus game, and Playful Corp recognizes that most people on other non-VR platforms may not have experienced it. Super Lucky's Tale has its own, self-contained story that explains itself from the beginning, so you're not missing anything vital if you don't have an Oculus.</p>\n<h2>How is this different from the regular Super Lucky's Tale?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/new-super-luckys-tale-everything-you-need-know\" title=\"New Super Lucky's Tale: Everything you need to know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/super-luckys-tale-nintendo-switch-01.jpg?itok=lBVEuzR3\"></a></p>\n<p>New Super Lucky's Tale is a slightly updated version of Super Lucky's Tale for the Nintendo Switch. It includes everything from Super Lucky's Tale, but with the addition of new levels, some additional story and characters, cinematics, new dialogue, and adjusted controls and visuals. If you've not played Super Lucky's Tale before, this is the best version to get, and if you've played before and loved the game, you may want to consider revisiting the Switch version to see all there is to see in the new game.</p>\n<h2>Is this game family-friendly?</h2>\n<p>Yes! New Super Lucky's Tale is rated E and its only potentially objectionable content is some cartoon violence. Its controls may be a bit complex for very young children trying to manage both camera movements and platforming at the same time, but older children comfortable with the controller can enjoy this game just as much as adults, without parents having to worry about the content.</p>\n<h2>Can I play with friends?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, no. New Super Lucky's Tale is a single-player title with no online capabilities. You can still invite friends to play with you, but you'll have to pass the controller back and forth.</p>\n<h2>When can I get it?</h2>\n<p>New Super Lucky's Tale is planned for launch on the Nintendo Switch on November 8, 2019. It will cost $40.</p>\n<h3>Everything old is new again</h3>\n<h4>New Super Lucky's Tale</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/new-super-luckys-tale-everything-you-need-know\" title=\"New Super Lucky's Tale: Everything you need to know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/super-luckys-tale-nintendo-switch-02.jpg?itok=UK09H1Bu\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Super-Luckys-Tale-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07VBB8PXZ?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57971YYr\" title=\"\">$40 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>3D mascot platformer revival</p>\n<p>New Super Lucky's Tale is a nostalgic throwback to 3D platformers of old, but it's also polished, modern, and sharp in the way that clunky N64 controls can't match.

The patent is titled &quot;Static Pattern Electrostatic Haptic Electrodes&quot;, and the abstract to the patent states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A virtual keyboard device includes a surface, a static pattern electrostatic haptic electrode disposed on an area of the surface, the static pattern electrostatic haptic electrode defining voids on the area of the surface between contiguous portions of the static pattern electrostatic haptic electrode, insulating material disposed on the static pattern electrostatic haptic electrode, and a controller operable to apply a voltage to the static pattern electrostatic haptic electrode. Application of the voltage to the static pattern electrostatic haptic electrode may produce a variable friction between a conductive object and the insulating material as the conductive object moves across the insulating material. In some implementations, the surface may be part of a display device that is configured to display a virtual key of a virtual keyboard in the area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The technology essentially revolves around a vibration actuator, configured to provide haptic feedback when it recieves an input. The description notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, a vibration actuator may be configured to provide haptic feedback when an input is received via a virtual keyboard presented on a touch display. Feedback for such components may enhance user experience as this may simulate physical responses users have come to expect from traditionally three-dimensional and mechanical apparatuses that have been more contemporaneously implemented using non-traditional mechanisms, such as flat surfaces that do not use moving parts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The patent is designed to improve the tactile response users experience when they type on screen. Naturally, this patent would seem to relate to Apple's devices which already use on screen keyboards, for example the iPhone and the iPad. However as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2019/10/future-ipad-virtual-keyboards-may-use-next-gen-haptics-technology-giving-users-a-superior-typing-experience.html\" title=\"\">Patently Apple</a> suggests:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although the patent figures in this patent application depict an iPad as the focus device, Apple claims that the invention could apply to other devices in the future including an iMac, MacBook, iPhones, kitchen appliances and more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As such, it seems from reports that the patent could be pointing to a future MacBook whereby the physical keyboard is replaced with a screen simulating a keyboard. Naturally, that sort of possibility could make for a wondrous two-screen device, and all the extra capabilities that would bring to a MacBook.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/w6P7ChkZeJ8\" height=\"1\">",

It's a fun game that pits players from around the world against each other in silly races. Unfortunately, you cannot choose to race against specific people just yet, but you can add friends to your Mario Kart Tour account and compare your scores.</p>\n<h2>What is Mario Kart Tour?</h2>\n<p>It's a mobile app available for both iOS and Android devices where you get to race other players from around the world in a simplified version of a classic game. Cartoony characters race around the track and use silly items like banana peels and shells to trip up other players. What makes this app fun is that it features courses seen in previous versions of the game as well as new courses inspired by real-world locations like New York. These real-world courses get swapped out every two weeks, so you'll have plenty of fun new locations to race through.</p>\n<p>There's currently a roster of 35 characters that racers can acquire. You'll see familiar faces like Mario, Bowser, and Peach, but you'll also see brand new racers like Pauline from the Nintendo Switch game, Super Mario Odyssey.

Cartoony characters race around the track and use silly items like banana peels and shells to trip up other players. What makes this app fun is that it features courses seen in previous versions of the game as well as new courses inspired by real-world locations like New York. These real-world courses get swapped out every two weeks, so you'll have plenty of fun new locations to race through.\nThere's currently a roster of 35 characters that racers can acquire.

The report suggests that the device will have a form factor and hardware similar to that of the iPhone 8, and be aimed at the 100 million people still using the iPhone 6.

Convincing hold-out users to update to a newer version that will use Apple's services well is potentially a reason as well.</p>\n<p>This is not the first rumor that discusses the possibility that a possible &quot;iPhone SE 2&quot; will be the size of the iPhone 8. The first discussions of that being the case were in Septemberin September, just prior to the iPhone 11 release.</p>\n<p>Existing Apple suppliers expected to benefit are FII, Catcher, and Jabil for casing pieces and casting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The article further suggests that the new phone would contain Apple's A13 processor and 3GB of ram.

While we don't have anything official from Disney just yet in terms of technical requirements, we can use what another top tier service does require to help us out. <a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87\">Netflix</a> has a breakdown of the average data used when streaming different video quality per hour.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Low</strong> - 0.3GB per hour per device.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium</strong> - SD: 0.7GB per hour per device.</li>\n<li><strong>High</strong> - Best video quality, up to 3GB per hour per device for HD, and 7GB per hour per device for Ultra HD</li>\n</ul><p>There are other factors to take into consideration when measuring how much data is used, such as video compression and your device's cache, but these numbers should give us a decent idea of what to expect.</p>\n<h3>So do I have enough data to stream?</h3>\n<p>Well, this is one of those questions that comes with an &quot;it depends&quot; answer. Typically if you are on Wi-Fi or connected via a wire to your internet, then data caps don't apply. However, if you are like me and have the unfortunate circumstance of a data cap on your home internet, then you're going to want to keep a close eye on your streaming. This will also apply to streaming video via your cellular devices.</p>\n<p>While there are all kinds of different data plans, the constant is that streaming video uses lots of data and in a hurry. If you're trying to minimize the amount of data used up while watching Disney+, or any streaming video service for that matter, it's best to keep the video quality as low as possible. While this may not look the best when viewing, it does use less data than those HD videos do. You can also connect your device to Wi-Fi to limit data usage.</p>\n<p>Depending on how you're streaming, home internet or cellular, be sure you know where you can track your data usage. Most providers have an app or website where you can log into your account and see where you are in your data allotment. The other option is that you can always give your internet or cellular provider a call to find out how much you have used and what your limit is.</p>\n<p>Again, these requirements are telling us what Netflix video streaming uses\u2014 not Disney+ \u2014 so these could change, but they are good starting points to lets us prepare for the launch of the service. While we do know a lot of <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus\">what is coming with Disney+</a>, there are a few technical aspects that aren't official, yet. We'll be sure to update you when we have more information.</p>\n\n<h2>Clasically futurisitc</h2>\n<h3>Disney+</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-much-data-does-disney-plus-use\" title=\"How much data does Disney+ use?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/disney-plus-logo-clear-11q4.png\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.disneyplus.com/\" title=\"\">From $7/mo at Disney+</a></p>\n<p>Ready for adventure</p>\n<p>Disney+ is the first service that will have everything Disney offers in one place.

Mime Jr is available in 5km eggs obtained from spinning Poke Stops in Europe, in the same regions its evolution Mr. Mime is available.</p>\n<h2>Can Mime Jr. or Mr. Mime be caught in the wild?</h2>\n<p>Mime Jr cannot currently be caught in the wild and is limited only to eggs. Mr. Mime can still be caught in the wild, but is also Europe-only as it's been from the start. Mr. Mime was available from 7km eggs for a limited time last month along with its regional brethren Tauros, Farfetch'd, and Kangaskhan, but that event has passed and he's returned to Europe-exclusivity.</p>\n<h2>Do you have to be located in Europe to get Mime Jr?</h2>\n<p>You do. Mime Jr will not hatch from eggs obtained anywhere else at the moment.</p>\n<h2>Can you hatch Mime Jr from a 7km egg obtained from someone in Europe?</h2>\n<p>You cannot. Mime Jr only hatches from 5km eggs right now, though it's possible he may move to 7km eggs down the line.</p>\n<h2>Will other regions get similar exclusives?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-go-how-obtain-mime-jr\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Go: How to obtain Mime Jr\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/worldtourismday2019.jpg?itok=SLIIBvM4\"></a></p>\n<p>Right now there is, unfortunately, an imbalance of exclusives depending on which region you're located in, with Europe having the extra Mime Jr. However, through the World Tourism Day event, some other regional exclusives are appearing in 5km eggs as well as in the wild. Here are the regional exclusives appearing in eggs right now, by region:</p>\n<p>Africa:</p>\n<ul><li>Heatmor</li>\n<li>Pansear</li>\n<li>Tropius</li>\n<li>Corsola (Kenya, Ethiopia, Madagascar)</li>\n</ul><p>Asia:</p>\n<ul><li>Farfetch'd (Japan, South Korea)</li>\n<li>Corsola (India, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Papus New Guinea)</li>\n<li>Chatot (India, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Papus New Guinea)</li>\n<li>Volbeat</li>\n<li>Torkoal (South Asia)</li>\n<li>Zangoose</li>\n<li>Lunatone</li>\n<li>Pansage</li>\n<li>Heatmor</li>\n<li>Pachirisu (Russia)</li>\n</ul><p>Australia and New Zealand:</p>\n<ul><li>Kangaskhan</li>\n<li>Corsola (Northern Australia)</li>\n<li>Chatot (Northern Australia)</li>\n<li>Volbeat</li>\n<li>Zangoose</li>\n<li>Lunatone</li>\n<li>Pansage</li>\n<li>Heatmor</li>\n<li>Relicanth (New Zealand and surrounding islands only)</li>\n</ul><p>Europe:</p>\n<ul><li>Mr. Mime</li>\n<li>Volbeat</li>\n<li>Zangoose</li>\n<li>Lunatone</li>\n<li>Tropius (Mediterranean Sea and surrounding areas)</li>\n<li>Mime Jr</li>\n<li>Pansear</li>\n<li>Durant</li>\n</ul><p>North America:</p>\n<ul><li>Tauros</li>\n<li>Heracross (Southern areas of Florida and Texas)</li>\n<li>Illumise</li>\n<li>Seviper</li>\n<li>Solrock</li>\n<li>Pachirisu (Alaska, areas of northern Canada)</li>\n<li>Panpour</li>\n<li>Durant</li>\n</ul><p>South America:</p>\n<ul><li>Heracross</li>\n<li>Corsola (Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico)</li>\n<li>Illumise</li>\n<li>Seviper</li>\n<li>Solrock</li>\n<li>Chatot</li>\n<li>Panpour</li>\n<li>Durant</li>\n</ul><h2>Will Mime Jr ever come to other regions?</h2>\n<p>Currently, that's unknown. Mime Jr is a frustrating exclusive since it's a &quot;baby&quot; Pok\u00e9mon that can't be caught in the wild, but it's not an evolution where if you had gained a Mr. Mime from the recent event you might be able to evolve him regardless of region. It's possible we'll see Mime Jr come overseas as the result of a special event later in the game, but for now, you'll have to be able to go on holiday to obtain one.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/T3vbvp-VQMA\" height=\"1\">",

One of these sensors could be pressed up against the tragus in the ear to allow the taking of biometric measurements. One such sensor could be a PPG sensor, which uses a pulse oximeter to illumate a patch of skin to measure changes in light absorption of the skin. Such a sensor can measure changes in the light absorption as caused by profusion of blood, allowing the earbuds to measure heart rate, blood volume and respiratory rate. With a slight variation to the light emitted, it could even measure VO2 max (the maximum amount of oxygen absorbed by the body).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-patent-reveals-earbuds-biometric-sensors\" title=\"Apple patent reveals earbuds with Biometric sensors\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/airpod-biometric-screenshot.jpg?itok=dszb2dv8\"></a></p>\n<p>The patent also states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the earbud is a wired earbud electrically coupled to another earbud with an electrode, the electrodes can cooperatively measure a number of different biometric parameters. In some embodiments, the electrodes can be configured to measure the galvanic skin response (GSR) of a user. A GSR can be useful in determining an amount of stress being experienced by the user at any given moment in time. In some embodiments, the electrodes can be used to measure more detailed parameters of the heart by taking the form of an electrocardiogram (EKG) sensor or an impedance cardiography (ICG) sensor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The sensors within the earbud, according to the patent would also be able to determine which ear your earbud has been placed in, and alter its operation accordingly.</p>\n<p>So there you have it, Apple could one day release earbuds that could measure your blood volume, heart rate, VO2 max, respiratory rate and stress.</p>\n<p>The full patent is available for your perusal <a href=\"http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=11&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&S1=(apple.AANM.+AND+20191003.PD.)&OS=aanm/apple+and+pd/10/03/2019&RS=(AANM/apple+AND+PD/20191003)\">here</a>.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/BM1Z9hPNVGY\" height=\"1\">",

Instead of having to go into the Home app for iOS and adjust settings for each individual light/fan/shade/thermostat, you can set up common actions in groups. You could, for example, have a scene called &quot;Good Night&quot; that will turn off all the lights in your home, set the thermostat to a cooler temperature, and draw the shades.</p>\n<p>Automations, on the other hand, are methods by which your smart home can control itself. You can use your device's location, a certain time of day, and other accessories to trigger Scenes and make adjustments to your smart home. You could, for example, set up an automation that turns on the light in the entryway every time you unlock the smart lock you've installed on the front door. You could also have certain lights in your home (like yard lights) turn on or off based on the sunrise and sunset.</p>\n<p>Sure, it's neat to be able to control your lights with the sound of your voice \u2014 &quot;Hey Siri, turn off the light in my bedroom.&quot; \u2014 but it's neater to not have to think about controlling your smart home, instead letting it do much of the work for you.

Instead of having to go into the Home app for iOS and adjust settings for each individual light/fan/shade/thermostat, you can set up common actions in groups. You could, for example, have a scene called &quot;Good Night&quot; that will turn off all the lights in your home, set the thermostat to a cooler temperature, and draw the shades.\nAutomations, on the other hand, are methods by which your smart home can control itself. You can use your device's location, a certain time of day, and other accessories to trigger Scenes and make adjustments to your smart home. You could, for example, set up an automation that turns on the light in the entryway every time you unlock the smart lock you've installed on the front door.

Hot on the heels of announcing a new <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/uber-launches-uber-works-app-beginning-chicago\">Uber Work</a> app, the folks at <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/uber-copter-first-ride/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b\">Road Show</a> have shared their experiences with Uber Copter.</p>\n<p>Now, Uber Copter isn't new. In fact, it launched earlier this summer but you had to be one of the chosen ones to get in on it. Now though, anyone can use it. You know, if a helicoptor is the only way you want to travel. And of course, you book the whole thing via the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber/id368677368\" title=\"\">Uber app</a>.</p>\n<p>Road Show says they booked a ride from the Bowery Ballroom in NYC to the TWA Hotel. In order to make that possible, Uber strings cars and helicopters together into one ride. A car picks you up and takes you to the helicoptoer and the helicoptor does the rest. Apparently that's called <em>Modality</em> and it's the hot new thing. It'll also include things like scooters eventually, but for now it's cars and helicopters. As if that isn't already cool enough.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But today we're talking helicopters and, after a short jaunt down from the Bowery to the Manhattan heliport in the back of an UberX Toyota Camry, the Uber app chimed to prompt me of my next mode of transport. This time the app listed the means of conveyance as a Black Bell 430 and, instead of a license plate number, it listed the tail number of the helicopter -- a nice touch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once you arrive at the helipad you check-in and go through some safety information, and then you're off. Road Show says the whole thing cost just shy of $200, which isn't cheap. But if you need to avoid traffic and have the money to spare, this has to be the most baller way of getting around NYC we've ever come across.</p>\n<p>Uber says this is only available to users of <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone\">iPhones</a> right now, but Android will be coming online at some point in the future. And it's only available from Manhattan to JFK, too.</p>\n<p>We'd suggest checking out the full Road Show rundown of how this all works, along with some awesome photographs of NYC from the air.

Hot on the heels of announcing a new Uber Work app, the folks at Road Show have shared their experiences with Uber Copter.\nNow, Uber Copter isn't new. In fact, it launched earlier this summer but you had to be one of the chosen ones to get in on it. Now though, anyone can use it. You know, if a helicoptor is the only way you want to travel. And of course, you book the whole thing via the Uber app.\nRoad Show says they booked a ride from the Bowery Ballroom in NYC to the TWA Hotel. In order to make that possible, Uber strings cars and helicopters together into one ride. A car picks you up and takes you to the helicoptoer and the helicoptor does the rest. Apparently that's called Modality and it's the hot new thing. It'll also include t...",

Uber Works is a platform that connects business with shift workers, in an attempt to positively impact the experience of workers and businesses. The release states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Uber Works Platform</p>\n<p>Uber Works looks to provide more clarity about available work by helping workers see all relevant and available shifts in one place.</p>\n<p>Uber Works app users can get detailed information about shifts they're interested in, including information about gross pay, work location and skills, or required attire. Uber Works also serves as a one-stop shop for all time-tracking needs, allowing users to clock in and out and log breaks.</p>\n<p>Uber Works helps ensure timely payments to workers and provides more transparency and opportunities for feedback in the marketplace. We believe technology can help workers feel more confident and empowered when it comes to finding shifts, and we are excited by the potential to build technology that can reduce the pain points workers experience each day.</p>\n<p>We believe a more efficient marketplace will also support businesses. By providing a reliable pool of vetted and qualified workers, Uber Works can help businesses reduce scheduling headaches, weather seasonal variations, and staff up for unexpected demand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Uber hopes that Uber Works will help people get faster and easier access to shift work, giving people as much information as possible prior to taking a job, and then ensuring they are payed on time once the work is completed.</p>\n<p>One of the key features Uber Works is that it has been created in partnership with staffing agencies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To do things right, we believe we need to take a partnership approach. That's why Uber Works has partnered with staffing agencies, including TrueBlue, who employ, pay and handle worker benefits. Uber Works is also committed to deliver services that support skill up-leveling and promote work re-entry and we are partnering with various organizations that support workers in their employment journey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On its official website, the industries available include: general labor, warehouse, back of house, customer service, front of house and cleaning. You can access the Uber Works website <a href=\"https://works.co/gb/en/\">here</a>, this includes download links for both iOS and Google Play, however at the time of writing these do not appear to be active.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/4n3RYso-Gk8\" height=\"1\">",

Specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.&quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Apple</a> assume our user are lawbreakers and therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the case.</p>\u2014 HKmap.live \u5168\u6e2f\u6297\u722d\u5373\u6642\u5730\u5716 (@hkmaplive) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hkmaplive/status/1179108329240424448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 1, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>According to the report by The Register:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the sole purpose of HKmap Live is to track police activity on the streets of Hong Kong and not to help people navigate to other locations. For example, at the time of writing \u2013 0300 Hong Kong time \u2013 there are only a few messages live but they are clearly intended to provide ongoing intelligence on police movements.</p>\n<p>&quot;After the tear gas was applied, the police officer immediately returned to the police station,&quot; reads one. &quot;Four flashing lights parked at the police station door,&quot; says another. Another simply reads: &quot;Riot.&quot; It is extremely easy to see at a glance where police activity is concentrated given the combination of messages and precise GPS locations.</p>\n<p>But local Hong Kong citizens have highlighted a quirk of local laws that provide a strong counter-argument: under the law, the Hong Kong police are obliged to wave a blue flag at the spot in which they which to declare that an illegal gathering is taking place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Protestors have been on the streets of Hong Kong since March 31, following proposed amendments to the country's extradition laws that may have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial. Hong Kong has been in state of unrest ever since, and the streets of Hong Kong remain an incredibly dangerous place. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-anniversary-timeline/timeline-key-dates-in-hong-kongs-protests-idUSKBN1WG3XK\">Reports</a> earlier this week suggest that one demonstrator has been shot, and that tear gas and water cannons have been used to quell protestors, reportedly armed with petrol bombs as recently as Tuesday of this week.</p>\n<p>With regards to this new app, The Register further said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The intent is to give citizens sufficient notice and time to move away from the area before any police action is taken. The HKmap Live app simply takes that official approach and extends it to citizens, allowing them to notify others of action that will be taken in specific locations.</p>\n<p>It is far from clear whether Apple has undertaken that kind of legal review, or whether it is choosing to follow local law or US law in declaring the app illegal. Apple has also, so far, refused to say whether it took the decision to ban the app in response to a request from the Chinese authorities</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The developer of the app took to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hkmaplive/status/1179419820078575621\">Twitter</a> in the last 24 hours to express hopefullness. Stating that it believed that the decision not to allow the app on the App Store was a bureaucratic mixup (not quite the word they used), rather than censorship. They further stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything can be used for illegal purpose on the wrong hand. Our App is for info, and we do not encourage illegal activity.</p>\n</blockquote></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/4qR4NxxU584\" height=\"1\">",

The news comes as institutions across Europe are celebrating EU code week this October.</p>\n<p>In a statement Apple sad:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This October, in classrooms across Europe celebrating EU Code Week, students of all ages are living proof that coding opens doors to opportunities never before possible. At Layton Primary School in Blackpool, England, coding principles are helping 5- and 6-year-olds track down a rogue dinosaur. And in Italy, at Milan's Institute De Amicis, coding is the key that unlocked a life-changing career for 28-year-old Belinda Tagariello.\nThese schools are part of a growing number of European institutions relying on the power and versatility of iPad, Mac and Apple's Everyone Can Code and App Development with Swift curricula to teach coding to a new generation of students. Both schools say the programmes have led to more engaged, innovative learning with proven results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Teachers from Layton Primary School in Blackpool, England spoke about how teaching their kids to code had not only given them an education in the art of coding itself, but had also transformed the way the kids approached all of their subjects. Clare Scott from the school stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Children would sit there (before) and wait for things to happen... But children with a coding mentality know that if they do something, something will happen. There will be an output if they put in an input \u2014 they are more resourceful in terms of being able to tackle problems.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The release also charted the story of Belinda Tagariello. She enrolled into a government-funded program and was taught Swift. Having learnt the ropes, she now teaches that same course at the Institute De Amicis in Milan. 41 students have completed the course, producing 14 apps between them. 16 of the graduates now have jobs in the tech industry, and a further 5 went on to enroll in university. 29 students will begin the course this October.</p>\n<p>Apple concluded by saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple's Everyone Can Code helps students from kindergarten to college and beyond learn coding to solve problems and prepare them for the workforce. With teacher guides and lessons, students learn the basics on iPad with Swift Playgrounds and App Development with Swift helps aspiring developers build their first iOS apps. Today more than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are using Everyone Can Code curriculum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's incredible to see how Apple is transforming everyday lives not just through its products, but also through education.

It was followed by Brazil with 10.7 million, or 11.8 percent, and Mexico with 5.8 million, or 6.4 percent.</p>\n<p>The United States led the pack for revenue too, with users in the country spending nearly $5.8 million or 45.4 percent of the total. Japan finished the week just behind with $4 million in player spend, or 31.3 percent, while France came third with $752k, or 6.4 percent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's very interesting to note that United States players only accounted for nearly 15% of downloads, but over 45% of revenue. The record might be short-lived however, as <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/call-duty-mobile-has-been-downloaded-over-20-million-times\">reports yesterday</a> confirmed that Call of Duty: Mobile has already been downloaded a whopping 20 million times in just its first two days, which would certainly put it on course to challenge Mario Kart Tour for the crown of fastest launching mobile game.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/qGgIEwdZlEk\" height=\"1\">",

However, the feature had some fundamental flaws that were brought to light by the OpenID Foundation in an open letter written by its Chairman, Nat Sakimura. The letter criticized Apple's implementation of Sign in with Apple as it restricted its availability, opened users to security issues, and left an undue burden on developers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The current set of differences between OpenID Connect and Sign In with Apple reduces the places where users can use Sign In with Apple and exposes them to greater security and privacy risks. It also places an unnecessary burden on developers of both OpenID Connect and Sign In with Apple. By closing the current gaps, Apple would be interoperable with widely-available OpenID Connect Relying Party software.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, Nat Sakimura has written a <a href=\"https://openid.net/2019/09/30/apple-successfully-implements-openid-connect-with-sign-in-with-apple/\">new open letter</a> to the company, praising their efforts to close the gaps identified in the first letter, but still points out a number of improvements that can be made. Reported by <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/02/sign-in-with-apple-better-but-not-perfect-says-openid-foundation-head\">AppleInsider</a>, the OpenID Foundation chairman expresses gratitude in Apple's efforts to address the group's original concerns while Sign in with Apple is still in beta:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;We applaud your team's efforts in quickly addressing the critical security and compatibility gaps identified and successfully implementing them while Sign In with Apple is still in beta. Now users will no longer be limited to where they can use the service and they can have confidence in their security and privacy.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The group has updated the <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/default/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md\">original document</a> that listed the concerns they had with Sign in with Apple to reflect the improvements that have been made, but they point out that there is still progress to be made:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Note that there are still some peculiarities identified in the open document. While these are not security issues, addressing them would make it even easier to use Sign In With Apple with existing OpenID Connect libraries. For instance, providing a discovery document would make it easier for existing software to be configured to use Sign In with Apple. We encourage your team to continue working through the issues identified.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These improvements to implementing Sign in with Apple will hopefully also help developers, who also expressed concerns around Apple's original policy that would require the option if your app offers social sign-in services like Facebook or Google. Apple has since <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-updates-policy-third-party-ads-kids-games-and-provides-more-sign-apple-info\">rolled back</a> some of those requirements too, so it is good to know the company is listening and acting fast to make sure the feature is great for both developers and their customers.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/DtdKJTNH_LA\" height=\"1\">",

DACA is an acronym for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program. However, this was the first amicus brief that included the names of Apple CEO Tim Cook and VP of Retail and People Deirdre O'Brien (via <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/02/apple-amicus-brief-supporting-daca/\">MacRumors</a>).</p>\n<p>Here the first part of Apple's amicus brief.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since 1976, Apple has made its name by designing, developing, selling, and maintaining cutting-edge consumer electronics including mobile communications devices, personal computers, and related software and services. Apple's success stems from its people. They shape and embody Apple's culture of innovation. Apple employs a diverse workforce of over 90,000 employees in the United States alone.</p>\n<p>Among those people are hundreds of DACA recipients who had no say in the decision to travel to this country and have known no other home. Apple employs DACA recipients who embody Apple's commitment to innovation in a wide variety of positions. As we explain below, they, and immigrants like them, are vital to Apple's success. They spark creativity and help drive innovation. They are among our most driven and selfless colleagues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DACA grants 800,000 kids who entered the country when they were 16 years or younger a two-year period of deferred action from deportation and a work permit to work in the country. Subsequently, Apple employs 443 Dreamers who hail from more than 25 different countries from around the world.</p>\n<p>It's become a hot button political issue, but nonetheless, Apple is stamping its support behind all Dreamers.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear the DACA case during the 2019 term. It'll begin hearing cases starting October 7.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/9kSsVXoYBeI\" height=\"1\">",

It's the 2018 iPad form factor that I already love and I'd happily take an iPhone that looks like this without hessitation. But there's a blemish that's difficult to ignore, That. Camera. Bump.</p>\n<p>It looks like it's the same camera bump \u2013 and presumably the same cameras \u2013 that we've now becomed accustomed to in <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11\">iPhone 11 Pro</a>. At first I thought it looked ugly there, too. But now I've spent time with the phone and used it daily, I don't even notice it anymore. It's the same as the notch that caused such a fuss in 2017. Nobody even notices it in 2019.</p>\n<p>My main question isn't whether the camera bump looks good. It's more about why it's there in the first place. We've all stood behind someone taking a photo with an iPad and rolled our eyes. But was that because the camera in previous iPas was bad? Possibly. Holding a 10-inch slab of glass to take a photo doesn't sound like my idea of fun, either.</p>\n<p>But what if those cameras <em>are</em> good. What if they're <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/iphone-11-pros-ultra-wide-camera-continues-impress\">iPhone 11 Pro</a> levels of good, like we're hearing. And what if you could record something in 4K and then edit it on a 12.9-inch screen right there and then, multi-touch and all? That might change things somewhat. It might, dare I say it, make iPad photography a thing.</p>\n<p>It just might.</p>\n<p>But what about you? What are your thoughts about the new iPad Pro \u2013 if indeed that's what we're looking at here \u2013 and that camera bump? I want to hear in the comments and in our poll. Light them up!</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"feedlyNoScript\"><a href=\"https://poll.fm/10423347\">How do you feel about the leaked iPad Pro cameras?</a></div></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/MyVO47n9T5U\" height=\"1\">",

While the betas contain new features, they also contain pre-release bugs that can prevent the normal use of your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or Mac, and are not intended for everyday use on a primary device. That's why we strongly recommend staying away from developer previews unless you need them for software development, and using the public betas with caution.

Most of the time this means minor changes to the new features Apple introduced along with performance and stability improvements, but here and there it introduces some delayed features that it hasn't really talked about.</p>\n<p>We're making it our mission to find these new features. The latest develper beta is no different. Here's everything new that Apple added with the latest developer beta of iOS 13, iPadOS 13 and their subsequent updates.</p>\n<h3>What's new with iOS 13.2 and iPadOS 13.2 beta 1?</h3>\n<p>Today Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-download-ios-13-developer-beta\">first developer beta for iOS 13.2</a>. The update adds a bevy of new features that did not show up with earlier iOS 13 updates like Deep Fusion. Besides the new features, not much changed with the design of iOS 13 aside from Apple fixing some of the <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/people-are-loving-ios-131-bugs-continue-hang-around\">annoying bugs</a> plauging it so far. This update seems to be geared towards launching the new features.</p>\n<p>Here are the notable changes with iOS 13.2 beta 1.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Deep Fusion:</strong> The long-awaited camera feature is now available. The feature uses the A13 Bionic's Nueral Engine to take multiple shots to create detailed images.</li>\n<li><strong>Announce Messages with Siri:</strong> The voice dictation feature makes its debut with iOS 13.2 beta 1. It allows Siri to read out messages through AirPods. It is not turned on by default. If you want to turn it on, go to Settings > Siri &amp; Search > turn on the Announce Messages toggle.</li>\n<li><strong>Research App:</strong> The Research app now has a section within the Settings. It will help academic and research institutions conduct researches.</li>\n<li><strong>AirPlay &amp; Handoff:</strong> The Handoff section found within General is now labeled AirPlay &amp; Handoff. It also adds new options to &quot;Transer to HomePod&quot; and &quot;Automatic AirPlay to TVs.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Volume Control within Control Center:</strong> Now when you have AirPods or Beats headphones, their icon will appear within the Volume Control. This feature is carried over from the new volume control on the home screen.</li>\n</ul><p>As we continue finding new features in the developer beta updates, we'll continue updating this post.</p>\n\n<h3>What's new with iOS 13.1 and iPadOS 13.1 beta 3?</h3>\n<p>Following its September 10 event, Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-download-ios-13-developer-beta\">third developer and public beta for iOS 13.1</a>. Like the second beta, Apple didn't make any noticeable changes aside from refining the new features it added with the first beta for iOS 13.1 (which you can see down below).</p>\n<p>Additionally, Apple rolled out the gold master version for iOS 13.0. This too doesn't offer any major updates aside from last-minute bug fixes and refinements ahead of its public release on September 19. That will be followed shortly by the public release of iOS 13.1 on September 30.</p>\n<h3>What's new with iOS 13.1 and iPadOS 13.1 beta 2?</h3>\n<p>Apple has released the <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-download-ios-13-developer-beta\">second developer beta for iOS 13.1</a>. Unlike the first beta, this one is short on changes. There seems to be no major changes or tweaks to the software.

If you don't then you could potentially lag behind the other players level as you play certain courses.</p>\n<p>I was always a Toad racer in Mario Kart, but this game makes me play all the drivers, regardless of my favorites. This is both a blessing and a curse. You have to try and get used to all the drivers and the war they work which makes you better at the game overall.</p>\n<h2>Should you buy them?</h2>\n<p>The game store does offer the option to buy these tickets when you reach a high enough level, but it will cost you Gold to purchase. You can get Gold from playing the game or spending 5 Rubies \u2014 the currency you pay real money for \u2014 to play a mini-game called Gold Rush.</p>\n<p>Gold Rush lets you collect several hundred coins in one race, and the more rubies you spend, the more you can multiply the number of coins you get.</p>\n<p>You shouldn't though. You get plenty of tickets as you play the game and spending a lot of real money to do it all faster really is counterproductive.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/Ocot3c5uTlw\" height=\"1\">",

I placed orders on a dozen different photo websites and reviewed each one individually. From each website, I ordered 4x6 prints in both color and black and white, wallet photos, an 8x10 print, a 20x30 print, a photo book, and the minimum order of cards. All of the professional engagement photos you see in my orders were taken by <a href=\"http://www.jmsimagery.com\">JMS Imagery</a>. I tried to order the least expensive version of each item, though it's not always easy to shop by price. In this article, I summarize my results, so you can have an easier time choosing where to buy your next set of photos, photo books, cards, or other photo products. While none of the services I tested were bad, my favorite online photo printing service was <a href=\"https://www.adoramapix.com\">AdoramaPix</a>, for its superior quality and attention to detail.</p>\n<h2>Best Overall: <em>AdoramaPix</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/07/adoramapix-lifestyle-screenshot-2.jpg?itok=XRh56w2a\"></a></p>\n<p>I struggled with which website to put in the top spot because other sites do have better prices and a larger variety of photo products you can order. Ultimately, I decided to go with quality above all else. This is the site I will be using for my own most precious memories going forward. I might use cheaper sites for basic prints, but when quality matters most, it will be AdoramaPix.</p>\n<p>AdoramaPix is laser-focused on a handful of products: prints, wall decor, photo books, albums, calendars, and cards. Within each category, you'll find a huge variety of options. The website is easy to use, and orders arrive well-packaged. AdoramaPix was one of only two websites I tried that didn't send my 20x30 print in a tube (which always results in curled edges.)</p>\n<p>There are three mobile apps if you prefer to upload and place orders on your iPhone or iPad. The quality of AdoramaPix's prints and photo products is outstanding. I especially loved the photo book and the photo card, both of which clearly stood out from the pack in quality. Take a closer look at <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/adoramapix-photo-printing-review\">AdoramaPix Photo Printing in my full review</a>.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>Excellent quality</li>\n<li>Even basic photo book exceeded expectations</li>\n<li>An incredible variety of photo book and print options</li>\n<li>Great packaging prevents damage and curling</li>\n<li>Easy to navigate website</li>\n<li>Special service for pros</li>\n<li>Card stock photo card printed on both sides, no logo, fancy envelope</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>Not a huge variety of photo gifts outside of prints and books</li>\n<li>Not the cheapest option</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Overall</h2>\n<h3>AdoramaPix</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/07/adoramapix-photo-printing-screenshot.jpg?itok=LrdQDqvR\"></a></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.adoramapix.com\">Prices vary</a></li>\n</ul><p>Quality first</p>\n<p>The quality of AdoramaPix's prints and photo products is outstanding. The photo book and the photo card particularly stood out from the pack in quality.</p>\n\n<h2>Best All-Around: <em>Snapfish</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/07/snapfish-lifestyle-screenshot.jpg?itok=74A3kIrW\"></a></p>\n<p>If you think that &quot;Best All-Around&quot; sounds an awful lot like &quot;Best Overall,&quot; you're correct. I had a tough time choosing which one to put in the top spot, so I hedged a bit. Snapfish does offer quite a few items and a huge variety of photo gifts that AdoramaPix does not. Snapfish's prices are consistently better than AdoramaPix's, plus you have the option to pick up certain items at CVS, Walgreens, or Walmart. While the quality isn't quite as exceptional on certain items, Snapfish will satisfy just about everyone.</p>\n<p>Snapfish's quality is great, prices are reasonable, and the website is easy to use. The selection of photo prints and gifts that Snapfish offers is enormous. I make a lot of photo books and their platform to make books is nicely done. The free, unlimited storage is a nice touch, as is the Snapfish app that lets you place orders and get additional deals.</p>\n<p>The packaging was sufficient to prevent damage, though you will get your posters rolled in a tube. While the photocard was beautifully printed on both sides, it does have a Snapfish logo on the back. These are tiny complaints in the scheme of things. Snapfish is an online photo service I can unreservedly recommend to anyone.

Truly, they are both excellent photo printing services. Snapfish's prices on most items are slightly less than Shutterfly's, but both offer so many deals and promo codes that original prices don't matter much. I was also more pleased with my cards at Snapfish.</p>\n<p>They were printed on card stock so both sides could be printed, while Shutterfly's cards were on photo paper. My 8x10 photo looks slightly blurry, but that may have been due to my photography skills. These are tiny quibbles, only because I needed a tie-breaker.</p>\n<p>I've actually been using Shutterfly in my personal life for over a decade. I trust Shutterfly with my family's precious memories. Shutterfly is the keeper of my children's childhood. I've ordered hundreds of prints, books, and gifts from Shutterfly over the years. I've never been disappointed. There are always deals and promo codes, and in fact, you can use three at a time on Shutterfly. Using the iOS app entitles you to extra freebies.

Amazon's big draw is the Amazon Photos app. Once set up, it will automatically back up all of your photos, and up to 5GB of video, for free, forever. You can go ahead and delete them off of your iPhone; Amazon has you covered.</p>\n<p>Amazon also offers a wide selection of photo prints and products at reasonable prices. Shipping is free for Prime members, which is an unusual feature among photo print services. Despite the less-than-perfect packaging and lack of some types of photo items, Amazon Photo Printing is a great service to keep in mind for your storage and printing needs.</p>\n<p>I was impressed by the customer service, which offered to refund or replace my photo that arrived slightly bent. It's easy to order from a huge selection of photo prints and other photo gifts; you can even do it right from your phone.

Yes, you can get prints ranging from mini-wallets to 20x30, photo books ranging from cheapie pocket-sized book to a premium leather-bound lay-flat album, cards, and all manner of photo gifts. You can even pick up some of these items at your local CVS the same day. But CVS is unusual in that they also offer passport photos, copy/print services, film developing, and home video transfer to DVD or digital.</p>\n<p>One aspect of my order really disappointed me, however. The theme I chose for my photo book, which consisted of decorative quotes and flair, either didn't show up at all over the background or covered up important parts of my photos.</p>\n<p>I'm generally pretty careful when I create photo books, but these aspects of the theme weren't apparent to me when I made this one.

Unlike most photo printing services, Walgreens also offers digital media transfer, passport photos, and film developing. The website and photo book creation platform are well-done. The quality of the items I ordered was great, and shipping was pretty fast. Same-day pickup at your local Walgreens is available for particular items.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to deal with a brick-and-mortar store, I thought Walgreens offered the best quality of all the drugstores and big box stores. Walgreens also has one of the better websites for when you do order online, plus a Walgreens app where you can order photos as well as manage prescriptions and other drugstore stuff.

If you're not looking to make a photo book, I can recommend Walmart for just about all of your other printing needs. The overall quality is good, though not quite as good as some others.</p>\n<p>Their prices are on par or less than most other places. Plus, there are always promo codes and deals going on. While the shipping isn't super fast, it is free on orders over $35 and cheap for smaller orders, which is unusual. You can also pick up some items in-store the same day you order them.</p>\n<p>The fact that you can order just one card at a low price is quite unusual. Keep in mind that cards are printed on photo paper, so you cannot print on the back of the card. The photo book platform is too frustrating to recommend using, but if you want to go for it anyway, the quality of the book is decent.

It has an interesting model that offers tons of freebies; you only pay for shipping and extras. It's a better photo printing service in some ways and worse in others, but it might be your perfect fit if you're the target audience.</p>\n<p>You get up to 85 4x6 prints, a 5x7 softcover 20-page photo book, and an 8x8 photo tile for free every month, but there is no commitment. This isn't a bad deal, even if you do pay to ship each freebie, which ranges from $2 to $10. You can certainly upgrade your order to more or larger or more premium options; you just pay for the upgrades.</p>\n<p>One example I could see being the target demographic is a busy parent. You could start a monthly collection, document your baby's first year, or, perhaps order yearly or just occasionally. The entire FreePrints universe is made for iOS; you couldn't order from a computer if you tried. For anyone who needs to take care of their photo needs on the go, FreePrints presents an interesting option.

I was happy overall with the quality of every order from every printing service, despite some annoying photo book creation platforms and some curled edges on the big print. Here's a quick rundown of the other photo printing services I tested.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/nations-photo-lab-photo-printing-review\">Nations Photo Lab Photo Printing</a> is one of my very favorites in terms of quality, especially for the two-sided, no-logo photo card. But the annoying photo book platform and the rolled edges of the 20x30 print kept it out of the top spot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/mpix-photo-printing-review\">Mpix Photo Printing</a> is another of the top-quality printing services, and the packaging was incredible. Mpix was one of just two sites that packed the 20x30 flat. But Mpix's website kept &quot;eating&quot; my photos, and the photo book creation tool was frustrating.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/mixbook-photo-printing-review\">Mixbook Photo Printing</a> is yet another of the extremely high-quality photo printers, with a rare two-sided, no-logo, and no-minimum order photo card. However, the photo book creation platform was frustrating. The 20x30 was not only rolled into a tube, but it kept its tightly rolled shape even after being weighed down flat overnight.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/costco-photo-printing-review\">Costco Photo Printing</a> offers an enormous selection of photo services, and prices are fair. Photo cards are especially cheap, but only if you're ordering in packs of 50. There are additional services in-store only, such as photo restoration. You must be a Costco member to print your photos and everything else there.</p>\n<h2>Bottom line</h2>\n<p>Quality-wise, all of the photo printing services I tested ranged from great to superlative. There wasn't a dud in the bunch. If you haven't tried <a href=\"https://www.adoramapix.com\">AdoramaPix</a>, go for it, especially if you have a special event you're ordering photos or photo products for. While AdoramaPix doesn't offer the same variety of photo products that most of the others do, the quality is unmatched.</p>\n<p>I particularly loved my photo book, which was a cheaper &quot;soft cover,&quot; and yet it was thick, durable archival paper. I also loved the photo card, which was printed on both sides, had no tacky logo, and came with a more upscale envelope. AdoramaPix was one of only two photo printing services that ships their large format prints in a flat box, so the poster arrived in perfect condition, perfectly flat. AdoramaPix even has special services for professional photographers.</p>\n<p>If you want the best combination of price, convenience, quality, and variety, <a href=\"https://snapfish.jedg.net/VKBL3\">Snapfish</a> wins by a hair. Seriously, it's just a hair. The website is easy to use, the variety of photo gifts available is staggering, the prices are fair, and promo codes are plentiful. Download the app for extra freebies. You can store your photos on Snapfish and/or upload your photos from various social media and photo sites. If you don't want to pay for or wait for shipping, you can pick up certain items at your several local drugstores.</p>\n<div><div>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-1.jpeg?itok=w4rB1UoA\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-1.jpeg?itok=w4rB1UoA\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-9.jpeg?itok=8v0DU4Vu\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-9.jpeg?itok=8v0DU4Vu\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-3.jpeg?itok=cG5xUCBX\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-3.jpeg?itok=cG5xUCBX\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-4.jpeg?itok=tD3YKQN_\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-4.jpeg?itok=tD3YKQN_\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-5.jpeg?itok=u20yFcC4\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-5.jpeg?itok=u20yFcC4\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-6.jpeg?itok=P3Jq9TOt\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-online-photo-printing-services\" title=\"Best Online Photo Printing Services in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/07/best-photo-printing-6.jpeg?itok=P3Jq9TOt\"></a></div> </div></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/NAMBxfQuZCA\" height=\"1\">",

All of the professional engagement photos you see in my orders were taken by JMS Imagery. I tried to order the least expensive version of each item, though it's not always easy to shop by price. In this article, I summarize my results, so you can have an easier time choosing where to buy your next set of photos, photo books, cards, or other photo products.

The beloved classic, Ni No Kuni Wrath of the White Witch, has just made its way onto the Nintendo Switch. It's a heartwarming tale that follows a young lad named Oliver who finds his way into a magical world that parallels his own. An evil wizard named Shadar has been corrupting the hearts of individuals and it's up to Ollie and his friends to make things right again.</p>\n<p>Though this game isn't that old, it has quite a release history. Way back in 2010 a DS game called Ni No Kuni: Dominion of the Dark Djinn released in Japan. A year later in 2011, the game was basically remade in Japan for PS3 under the title Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch. This PS3 version later found it's way to America in January 2013. This year the game has been remastered for PC and PS4, but the Nintendo Switch version is really just a rerelease of the 2010 game. Considering how simple the graphics are and that the Switch can't handle really high resolution, the 2010 version is ideal for the Switch, though the actual game Switch version does have some issues.</p>\n\n<h3>Pure of heart</h3>\n<h4>Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/ni-no-kuni-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Ni No Kuni for Nintendo Switch review: A charming fairy tale adventure\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch.jpg?itok=Dp7jdKqJ\"></a></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: This rereleased classic is a delightful adventure for any Switch owner.

The beautifully animated cinematic cut scenes were created by the Japanese animation studio, as is evident by the familiar look of the characters. As with just about every Ghibli movie, this game explores the wonders of childhood as well as some serious issues. I absolutely love watching the animated bits; it really does feel like you're watching a movie in parts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The game explores the wonders of childhood as well as some serious issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Part of me finds the plot to be oversimplified and cheesy, but the earnest voice acting, innocent-looking characters, and gorgeous landscapes all come together to make Ni No Kuni work the way the creators intended. Going along with the childlike simplicity of the artwork, the play style of this game is very simple. Anyone looking for an intense JRPG won't find it here. However, this is a fun laid back game for anyone looking for something upbeat and relaxing.</p>\n<h3>Fighting and Familiar collecting <em>Feels a bit like Pok\u00e9mon</em></h3>\n<p>Near the beginning of the game, Oliver discovers he's a wizard who can control Familiars in battle. You'll issue commands to your Familiars, but this is not a turn-based RPG. You can run around freely or cancel a command if you want during a fight, which is a mechanic I like.</p>\n<p>Players will come across wild Familiars as they travel between cities. Sometimes when you're fighting one of these beasts, the creature takes a liking to you, which allows you to serenade it and attempt to win it over to your side. If you're successful, this beast becomes a partner that one of your companions can fight with. I personally love this part of the game. Collecting Familiars feels a lot like catching Pok\u00e9mon and there are several different looking creatures to collect.</p>\n<p>Each Familiar has its own abilities and fighting styles. You can also equip these creatures with weapons, shields, cloaks, and amulets to increase their stats. They earn experience points in battle and can level up. When they're leveled up enough, they can even undergo a metamorphose to change their look and become stronger. It's a lot like when a Pokemon evolves. The big difference is that metamorphosed Familiars are sent back to level one and must be leveled up again.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-clone-id=\"purch_Y_L_0_1\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch <em>What I don't like</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/ni-no-kuni-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Ni No Kuni for Nintendo Switch review: A charming fairy tale adventure\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/ni-no-kuni-review-008.jpg?itok=UoOr_eka\"></a></p>\n<p>As with any game, Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch isn't perfect. Some of its imperfections are due to the mechanics of the game itself, but others are due to the way it runs on the Nintendo Switch console.</p>\n<h3>Receiving errors <em>Closing the game</em></h3>\n<p>Before testing Ni No Kuni myself, I read that the game had a tendency to crash while people were playing it. This made me very wary of the game at first and had me saving every chance I got. But after playing for a few hours without incident, I let my guard down. The game eventually did crash on me and it was pretty upsetting considering that I had been an idiot and hadn't saved for roughly 30 minutes. When I was finally able to get the game running again, I had to run around and redo some of the things I'd already done.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The game crashed on me four times during the first 12 hours of play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After that, I was much more dutiful in saving every chance I got. The game crashed on me four times in the first 12 hours of play. I'm not sure what causes it, but it's definitely annoying. For me the game never froze during a cut scene, it was always while I wandered about a town or the large world map that the game had an error and closed. This is truly frustrating and is a huge downside to playing the game on the Switch. With any luck, Bandai Namco will release a patch to solve this issue.</p>\n<h3>Slow plot progression <em>Holds your hand too much</em></h3>\n<p>The other big thing that I disliked about this game was how slowly the plot progressed. The game can be frustrating for experienced gamers who know how RPGs work since it elaborately explains common game elements with long-winded dialogue and cut scenes. Considering that it looks like the game was meant for little children, it kind of makes sense that the game would hold your hand like this. However, it's still frustrating for anyone who's ever played a game before.</p>\n<p>Oliver, in particular, is especially slow at catching on to where the plot is going and needs to have his companions explain everything to him. It would be a lot better of a game if the main character didn't slow the momentum of every new discovery. It leaves for some fun dialogue between the spunky characters, but it also leaves you twiddling your thumbs or spamming the A button to skip through to the next part.</p>\n<p>You also have to do things in the order that the game wants you to. For example, I learned a spell early in the game that allowed me to spring open locks. Right after learning it, I tried using it on a locked door, but the spell didn't respond. Literally just a few minutes later after completing a cut scene, I was directed back to that same locked door and this time the spell worked.</p>\n<h2>Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch <em>Bottom Line</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/ni-no-kuni-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Ni No Kuni for Nintendo Switch review: A charming fairy tale adventure\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/ni-no-kuni-review-011.jpg?itok=y0e3qvOI\"></a></p>\n<p>Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is a delightful fantasy romp through the eyes of a child. Parts of the game can be a bit drawn out, but overall the heart of this game is what draws so many people to it. It's upbeat, relaxing, and just downright charming. Much of this is due to the earnest voice acting and also due to the gorgeous art style provided by Studio Ghibli. As long as you aren't expecting a challenging JRPG, you'll enjoy the simple characters and gameplay of this adventure. Just be sure to save frequently on your Switch since the game has a tendency to freeze and close.</p>\n<p> </p><div>\n<span>4</span>\n<span>out of 5</span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </div>\n<p>This lighthearted journey brings back the feeling of awe I felt in my childhood. It's got its flaws and definitely holds your hand a little too much, but it's an enjoyable game overall.</p>\n\n<h3>Pure of heart</h3>\n<h4>Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/ni-no-kuni-nintendo-switch-review\" title=\"Ni No Kuni for Nintendo Switch review: A charming fairy tale adventure\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch.jpg?itok=Dp7jdKqJ\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ni-Kuni-Wrath-White-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07SR1KX3T?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57655YYr\" title=\"\">$42 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>Master magic in a fairy tale world</p>\n<p>This beautifully animated classic has you following a young boy named Oliver who finds himself in a magical world.

But it wasn't until recently that Apple really made its own push in that space as it created more first-party apps that come in direct competition with many third-party apps.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Being a default app on the world's best-selling smartphone is valuable because consumers are subtly coaxed and prodded into using this more-established software rather than alternatives. For example, Safari is the iPhone's default web browser, so when a user clicks a link to a website, it will automatically open there, even if other browsers are on the handset.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bloomberg notes that in 2007, the iPhone only came with 17 pre-installed apps. Now it comes with 38 pre-installed apps. It goes on to compare iOS to Microsoft of the 1990's when it actively tried to shut down web browsers that went up against Internet Explorer.</p>\n<p>To be clear, there is no evidence Apple is trying to do that. But in pushing its apps first, that sets up an environment where most users will settle to using Apple Maps or Safari as opposed to downloading apps like Waze or Google Chrome.</p>\n<p>Apple is fighting back against this narrative.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple said new iPhones come with in-house default apps to create a seamless user experience, while improving performance, battery life, security and privacy. &quot;We have also created the App Store, the safest place to get apps, so customers can choose from millions of apps to find the ones that further enhance their iPhone,&quot; a company spokesman wrote in a statement. &quot;In the few categories where Apple also has an app, we have many successful competitors.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's also worth noting that Apple isn't the only one doing it. Bloomberg notes that Google ships the Pixel device with 30 pre-installed apps while Android devices come with Google's apps as well. Google was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-17/google-said-to-have-11th-hour-call-with-eu-ahead-of-android-fine\">fined 4.3 billion euros</a> by European antitrust regulators. The big difference is that with Android devices you can change default apps to non-Google ones but you can't do that on iPhones.</p>\n<p>This is a deep conversation about antitrust competition in smartphones that not only involves Apple but companies like Google and Samsung as well. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-10-02/iphone-ios-users-can-t-change-default-apps-safari-mail-music\">Bloomberg's piece</a> goes into much more detail and warrants a read.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/Lxov8-89-yw\" height=\"1\">",

Nintendo is doing its best to make it feel like you're competing in real-time PvP when you're just going up against some convincing (most of the time, anyway) bots. Why did the company do this? Presumably to avoid having the server issues that multiplayer might cause, as Nintendo hasn't really done a mobile game to date that has required that kind of tech.</p>\n<h3>But Nintendo has at least thought about multiplayer</h3>\n<p>This might be a bit premature, but Nintendo does seem to have a road map for Mario Kart Tour that includes live multiplayer. If you go to the game's main menu screen, there's a 'Multiplayer' icon with a very peppy &quot;Inbound!&quot; message.

While the process isn't completely iPhone-free yet, it wouldn't be surprising to see it become so over the course of this beta cycle. Here's how, as of right now, you can update your Apple Watch through the watch itself.</p>\n<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your Apple Watch, either by using Siri or your app list.</li>\n<li>Tap <strong>General</strong>.</li>\n<li>Tap <strong>Software Update</strong>.</li>\n<li>Tap <strong>Install</strong>.</li>\n<li>Tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li>\n<li>Open the <strong>Watch app</strong> on your iPhone.</li>\n<li>Agree to the <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> while still on your iPhone.</li>\n<li>On your Apple Watch, tap <strong>Download &amp; Install</strong></li>\n</ol><p>Your Apple Watch still needs to be on a charger for the update to install, and it won't do so until your watch has a battery level of at last 50%.</p>\n<h2>How to downgrade watchOS</h2>\n<p>Instructions for reverting back to watchOS are behind the developer center log in, so we can't replicate them here. Suffice it to say you can't do it on your own. Your Apple Watch will have to go back to Apple. That alone should give anyone who doesn't absolutely <em>need</em> the developer beta pause to reconsider installing it in the first place.</p>\n<p>For developers who, for whatever reason, really do need to revert, you can find instructions for contacting Apple at the bottom of this document:</p>\n<ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/unauthorized/\" title=\"\">watchOS Beta Software Installation Guide (PDF)</a></li>\n</ul><p></p><p></p>\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-series-5-review\">Apple Watch</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-3\"><img width=\"600\" src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/field/image/2019/09/apple-watch-series-5-hero.jpg\" height=\"338\"></a></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-series-5-faq\">Apple Watch Series 5 FAQ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/watchos-6-faq\">watchOS 6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/where-buy-apple-watch-series-5\">Where to buy Apple Watch Series 5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-set-and-start-using-your-apple-watch\">Apple Watch users guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-watch\">Apple Watch news</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forums.imore.com/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch discussion</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p></p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/FRqyzjYsG60\" height=\"1\">",

You need to install a certificate on your Apple Watch, then download the software to your iPhone running the iOS 13 beta, transfer it across, and get it up and running. It's not hard, but it does take patience and you may have to troubleshoot.\nApple occasionally offers updates to iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS as closed developer previews or public betas for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and Mac (sadly, no public beta for the Apple Watch). While the betas contain new features, they also contain pre-release bugs that can prevent the normal use of your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or Mac, and are not intended for everyday use on a primary device.

It truly stands out against not only other Apple Watches, but probably most of the other watches you'll encounter in your day-to-day life. You'll pay for that privilege of standing out, though.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Durable titanium or eye-catching white ceramic? Apple's latest premium watches are both beautiful, so which one's for you?</p>\n<p>Here's the deal: unless you both have the money to spend and really like the aesthetics of it, there's no practical reason to get the ceramic version of the Apple Watch Series 5. It's more expensive, it's heavier, and there's only one color option. The titanium, Apple Watch, on the other hand, has two colors, and starts at <em>$500</em> less than the ceramic model. It's greater price gap, in fact, than the one between the starting prices of the aluminum and stainless steel watches.</p>\n<h2>Titanium vs. ceramic: What are the differences?</h2>\n<p>When it comes to the internal components and screen material, the titanium and ceramic Apple Watches are no different from one another. They have the same sapphire crystal screen, they're both Wi-Fi + Cellular models, and they both come with 32GB of internal storage (as does the rest of the Series 5 lineup).</p>\n<p>So the real difference is in the materials. Titanium is a lighter material, stronger than stainless steel and, in many situations, a better choice for durability than the ceramic. Ceramic is more scratch-resistant, but it's an overall more brittle material. So, if you've ever had a problem with your watch band unfastening and your watch dropping to the ground, the titanium watch will likely hold up better against that sort of thing over time.</p>\n<p>There are also the aesthetics of the watches to consider. You really have to like the look of the mostly-white body of the ceramic watch to shell out of it. And to a certain extent, that's also true with the titanium watch. But at least with the titanium model, you have both a standard and a black color option. The ceramic Apple Watch only comes in white.</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th></th>\n<th>Titanium Apple Watch</th>\n<th>Ceramic Apple Watch</th>\n</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Starting price</td>\n<td>$799</td>\n<td>$1,299</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Weight</td>\n<td>35.1g (40mm) <br> 41.7g (44m)</td>\n<td>39.7g (40mm) <br> 46.7g (44m)</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Screen material</td>\n<td>Sapphire crystal</td>\n<td>Sapphire crystal</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Back material</td>\n<td>Sapphire crystal and ceramic</td>\n<td>Sapphire crystal and ceramic</td>\n</tr><tr><td>GPS-only</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Finish</td>\n<td>Brushed</td>\n<td>Polished</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Colors</td>\n<td>Silver <br> Space black</td>\n<td>White</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>From a practical perspective, the titanium Apple Watch is the Apple Watch to get. It's lighter on both your wrist and your wallet and features a second color option. It's also stronger overall, and, depending on your tastes, may look better with more of Apple's available bands.</p>\n<p>But the thing about fashion accessories (which the Apple Watch is, as something you wear on your wrist) is that it's not all about practicality. If practicality was your main concern, you'd have skipped both of these and gotten an aluminum model, or at the most a stainless steel one for the sapphire screen. But you didn't do that. Instead, you're looking at the two most expensive non-Herm\u00e8s watches that Apple makes.</p>\n<p>Because something is striking about that ceramic watch. It's singular amongst all of the Apple Watch casing and band combinations you can get. The white is going to stand out wherever you go, and people will take a second, even if only a second, to look at it. It's not the most practical choice, but if it fits your aesthetic sensibilities and your budget, there's no reason not to go for it.</p>\n<h2>Titanium Apple Watch Series 5</h2>\n<p>Strong and practical</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-titanium-vs-ceramic\" title=\"Apple Watch Titanium vs Ceramic: Which should you buy?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/apple-watch-series-5-titanium-cropped.jpeg?itok=2N2pBQYd\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F159229%2F554233%2F7613%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU58038YYr%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fshop%252Fbuy-watch%252Fapple-watch&token=ZDZfE8r6\" title=\"\">From $799 at Apple</a></p>\n<p>Lighter, stronger, and less expensive.</p>\n<p>A much less expensive option than the ceramic watch, but overall stronger and lighter than its more expensive counterpart.

                "content": "<div><p>I went down an interesting rabbit hole a few days ago. I've been writing mostly Swift at work for over a year now, so my Objective-C practice became somewhat rusty. Anyways, that day was a different day, because I was working on something in the Objective-C part of our code. I had a few &quot;lol&quot; moments as I witnessed myself struggling with the syntax, but then I ran into something interesting as the result of my new Swift habits.</p>\n<p>I wanted to add an extra argument to the existing initializer of a class:</p>\n<pre><code>- (instancetype)initWithPhotoItem: (PhotoItem *)photoItem\n                            state: (AnnotationViewState *)state\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm so used to Swift by now, I made a mistake:</p>\n<pre><code>- (instancetype)initWithPhotoItem: (PhotoItem *)photoItem\n                            state: (AnnotationViewState *)state\n          annotationFilterService: AnnotationFilterService\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead of defining an <code>annotationFilterService</code> named argument as <code>(AnnotationFilterService *) annotationFilterService</code>, I just mistakenly defined the <code>AnnotationFilterService</code> class. Exactly like how I would define function arguments in Swift code. The code compiled, the app was running happily, and things only started falling apart once I actually tried to use the <code>annotationFilterService</code> argument, that didn't exist.</p>\n<p>It came as a surprise to me that the code compiled and the initializer was running fine this way, so I wanted to understand why.</p>\n<p>After giving it some thoughts I concluded that the <code>AnnotationFilterService</code> class must be an object. I assumed that somewhere not-so-deep down there, my method definition is being translated to something correct, and that's why the compiler and even the runtime is fine with it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>UPDATE: As it turns out at the end, the <code>AnnotationFilterService</code> definition could've been anything, like <code>asd</code>. As Jeff Johnson pointed out on Twitter, it's just an untyped parameter name in this context:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">AnnotationFilterService is simply a parameter name in this context. It can be anything and will shadow any class names.</p>\u2014 Jeff Johnson (@lapcatsoftware) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1179432324129329152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2019</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, following my intuition before knowing the answer, I figured I would take a closer look at classes, objects, and methods to understand more.</p>\n<h2>What is a Class?</h2>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4\">the (open source) runtime code</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>/// An opaque type that represents an Objective-C class.\ntypedef struct objc_class *Class;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When looking at the <code>objc_class</code> struct, we can see that it inherits from the <code>objc_object</code> struct. (It's C++ code)</p>\n<pre><code>struct objc_class : objc_object {\n    Class superclass;\n    cache_t cache;\n    class_data_bits_t bits;\n\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Quickly jumping over to this <code>objc_object</code> struct, we will see what an Objective-C object is, and what's the one thing <code>objc_class</code> will inherit from it. The <code>isa</code> (<a href=\"http://www.sealiesoftware.com/blog/archive/2013/09/24/objc_explain_Non-pointer_isa.html\">value, or pointer</a>), that's also a <code>Class</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>/// Represents an instance of a class.\nstruct objc_object {\n    Class _Nonnull isa  OBJC_ISA_AVAILABILITY;\n};\n\n/// A pointer to an instance of a class.\ntypedef struct objc_object *id;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alright, so an Objective-C class is technically an object with more fields. Still, many questions arise. First of all: what does the compiler translate method definitions to?</p>\n<h2>Message sending</h2>\n<p>In order to find it out, let's first look at how message sending works, what happens when we send a message to an object in Objective-C. When running the line of code <code>[object message];</code> the implementation of the <code>message</code> method on <code>object</code> gets resolved to a function during runtime. First, the compiler translates that expression to something that corresponds to <code>objc_msgSend(object, @selector(message))</code>. In order to resolve the instance method to the underlying function, the system needs to know what <em>class</em> the receiver object is an instance of, because that's where it can look up the implementation of the selector passed in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is different from how other languages implement this, using a vtable for example, that is bound to the object, not the class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>isa field</h3>\n<p>The <code>Class</code> of an object is determined by looking at the first of all variables of it, the <code>isa</code> field. Since every object has an <code>isa</code>, and a <code>super_class</code> field, all objects have access to their <code>Class</code>, and all the <code>Class</code>es up in their hierarchy. For instance member lookup, the runtime first follows the object's class's method list for the selector via its <code>isa</code> field, and if it can't find it there, the superclasses, and so on, until it reaches the root.</p>\n<h3>Method lists</h3>\n<p>The <code>method_lists</code> field of the object is a compiler generated list of the methods on the given class. This is a list of <code>Method</code>s, where <code>Method</code> is just an alias for <code>objc_method</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>struct objc_method {\n    SEL _Nonnull method_name                                 OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE;\n    char * _Nullable method_types                            OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE;\n    IMP _Nonnull method_imp                                  OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE;\n}                                                            OBJC2_UNAVAILABLE;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When looking through these methods, the system finds the method with the matching <code>method_name</code>. If there was no match in the object's class' method list, or any of the object's class' superclasses' method lists, the app will crash with the probably familiar <code>&quot;unrecognized selector sent to instance&quot;</code> message.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's a method caching mechanism involved in this process to make this more efficient. Look up the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtHowMessagingWorks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008048-CH104-SW1\">docs</a> on <code>objc_cache</code> if you're interested in more details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When a matching method was found though, the attention turns to the <code>method_imp</code> field of the identified method. This <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime/imp\"><code>IMP</code></a> is a pointer to the start of the function that implements the method. This function can be called C-style, passing in the pointer to the object itself first, then the selector, and its arguments following. This is what gets called at the end.</p>\n<h3>Method signature</h3>\n<p>When us developers are looking at Objective-C methods on the other hand, all we see is a return type, a name, and arguments. What it <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmethodsignature?language=objc\">looks like actually</a>, is a bit more.</p>\n<p>Every method has an implicit <code>self</code>, and a <code>_cmd</code> argument that's hidden from our eyes, but we have access to them. After these two, follow the arguments defined by the developer in the Objective-C code.</p>\n<h2>Classes are objects</h2>\n<p>Circling back to the original finding, that <code>Class</code> is an object, we can now try to imagine how sending messages to classes work following the same principles as above. When we send the <code>string</code> message to the <code>NSString</code> class (<code>[NSString string]</code>), something very similar happens to what we were just looking at. The compiler translates the expression to an <code>objc_msgSend</code> function call first, and the runtime will try to resolve the class of the object through the <code>isa</code> field.</p>\n<p>But wait, if the class itself is a <code>Class</code> (i.e. <code>NSString</code>), what is the class of the class will be?</p>\n<h3>Meta classes</h3>\n<p>A meta-class. A meta-class is what holds the method list of the class. The <code>isa</code> field of a <code>Class</code> is what points to the class' meta-class. When sending the <code>string</code> message to <code>NSString</code>, the runtime will find it in <code>NSString</code>'s meta-class' method list.</p>\n<p>Let's write a small function to find out what the class, and meta-class of a certain class is. This can help us understand what's happening.</p>\n<pre><code>void findClass(Class class) {\n    const char* className = class_getName(class);\n    NSLog(@&quot;%s's class: %p&quot;, className, class);\n    NSLog(@&quot;%s's meta-class: %p&quot;, className, objc_getMetaClass(className));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When passing in <code>NSString.class</code>, the results were the following:</p>\n<pre><code>NSString's class: 0x7fff87b450e8\nNSString's meta-class: 0x7fff87b45110\n</code></pre>\n<p>I paused the execution right there, and asked lldb to give me what kind of objects these memory addresses represent.</p>\n<pre><code>(lldb) po 0x7fff87b450e8\nNSString\n\n(lldb) po 0x7fff87b45110\nNSString\n</code></pre>\n<p>They are both <code>NSString</code>s, but the second one is a meta-class. The only thing that distinguishes it from the plain class is that we know they're pointing to different things in memory.</p>\n<p>There's more to learn about meta-classes, so if you're interested, I recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.cocoawithlove.com/2010/01/what-is-meta-class-in-objective-c.html\">Matt Gallagher's What is a meta-class in Objective-C?</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.sealiesoftware.com/blog/archive/2009/04/14/objc_explain_Classes_and_metaclasses.html\">Greg Parker's Classes and metaclasses</a> writing.</p>\n<h3>Type Encodings reveal more</h3>\n<p>Now that we know all this, we can go back to finding out how method definitions look like under the hood. The final step of this investigation was figuring out a way to see what the runtime sees when looking at my method.</p>\n<p>Let's recreate the original confusion in a more simple example:</p>\n<pre><code>- (void)someMethod:justAString {\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to get the type encoding information, we'll use the <code>method_getTypeEncoding</code> runtime function. This function requires one argument to pass in, a <code>Method</code>. We already know what <code>Method</code> is, and how to get to it! Remember that <code>objc_class</code> had an <code>objc_method_list</code> field on it, that points to the list of <code>Method</code>s defined for the class. What we want to do here is to get a list of the methods for my class, and look at the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008048-CH100\">type encodings</a> for the method in question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In short, type encodings are compiler generated character strings associated with the method selector.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's see how they look like and how to get them!</p>\n<h3>Type encoding lookup and decryption</h3>\n<p>The following function takes a class and a selector, and returns the selector's type encoding. Let's use this to find out what type encodings my <code>someMethod:</code> method has right now.</p>\n<pre><code>const char * typeEncodings(Class class, SEL selector) {\n    unsigned int outCount = 0;\n    Method *methodList = class_copyMethodList(class, &amp;outCount);\n\n    int i = 0;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; outCount; i++) {\n        Method m = methodList[i];\n        SEL sel = method_getName(m);\n\n        if (sel == selector) {\n            return method_getTypeEncoding(m);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return nil;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>In my view controller's <code>viewDidLoad</code>, I print out the results.</p>\n<pre><code>NSLog(@&quot;%s&quot;, typeEncodings(ViewController.class, @selector(someMethod:)));\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following gets printed on the debug console:</p>\n<pre><code>v24@0:8@16\n</code></pre>\n<p>Decrypting this information we get that the return type of the method is void, because it starts with a <code>v</code>, 24 is the size of the argument frame. <code>@0</code> is an Objective-C object at byte offset 0, which is the implicit <code>self</code> argument. As far as I understand these byte offsets aren't used by modern systems anymore.<code>:8</code> is the selector (implicit <code>_cmd</code>) at byte offset 8. <code>@16</code> is the interesting part, because it indicates another Objective-C object at byte offset 16, and that has to be our untyped argument.</p>\n<p>When running again but first removing the argument from the method, we get:</p>\n<pre><code>v16@0:8\n</code></pre>\n<p>The last object argument is not there in this case.</p>\n<p>This was enough evidence for me to see that my odd method definition indeed translates to something that makes sense to the compiler, and the runtime too. As it turns out, I wasn't completely right, because I believed that this object at the end of the method would be an <code>AnnotationFilterService</code> class, but as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1179429811665719296\">Jeff Johnson explained to me on Twitter</a>, it's just a result of a mechanism where an untyped parameter is assumed to be <code>id</code>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Either way, it was a good journey down to the lower levels, that helped me to some new and interesting learnings along the way \ud83d\ude04 Hope you enjoyed, too!

The bamboo surface is smooth and has the Fuse logo engraved in it. The edges of the charger are chamfered, or angled at 45 degrees, for an elegant look and feel. This is a wireless charger you want on your desk or nightstand. It looks fabulous with just about any decor.</p>\n<p>Sizewise, it's pretty similar to the iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone X, and iPhone XS. It measures 3.94-by-6.3-by-0.79 inches. This makes it easy to plop your phone down upon it; you don't have to guess where to place your phone to be sure it's lined up properly with the charging element. That said, I tried placing it at different angles, and that worked just fine too. A one-meter long USB Type-A charging cable is included, and it is built into the charger. You'll need to provide your own wall charger because none is included. A blue light glows when the charger is actively charging. I tested the charger with my iPhone in various cases, and it worked fine even with the thicker cases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger looks amazing with any decor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger offers 10W wireless fast charging, though in my experience it was still slower than plugging the iPhone into a wall charger via its Lightning port. Apple devices currently can only use 7.5W anyway. You can use the Fuse Chicken Gravity Touch Wireless Charger with any iPhone model from the iPhone 8 to the current models. You can also use it with any Qi-enabled smartphone or device.</p>\n<p>If you prefer a wireless charger that stands up, Fuse Chicken also makes <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/fuse-chicken-gravity-lift-wireless-charger-review\">GRAVITY LIFT Wireless Charger</a>. Or, go truly wireless with Fuse Chicken's <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/fuse-chicken-universal-all-one-travel-charger-review-everything-you-need\">Universal All-in-One Travel Charger</a>, which also comes with travel adapters and charges your USB Type-A and USB Type-C devices.</p>\n<h4>Functional decor</h4>\n<h2>Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger: <em>What I like</em></h2>\n<p>It's just plain beautiful. There are certainly cheaper wireless chargers out there that function just as well, but this one is much better looking. The chamfered aluminum edges complement the sustainable bamboo top portion. I can see this one going with just about any decor from clean and modern to warm and rustic. I like that the size and shape are so similar to the iPhone, making it easy to place your phone correctly for optimal charging.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-review\" title=\"Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger review: Bamboo beauty\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/img_0646.jpegfuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-2.jpeg?itok=Avi3y0F_\"></a></p>\n<h4>Slower</h4>\n<h2>Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger: <em>What I don't like</em></h2>\n<p>It's hard to make a case for &quot;needing&quot; a wireless charger when plugging into a wall charger is faster. Though this is an industry-standard 10W charger, it doesn't charge up an iPhone particularly fast as it's limited to 7.5W when charging an iPhone. That said, it is nice having one on your nightstand so you can plop it down before bed, avoiding fumbling in the dark with the Lightning port.</p>\n<h4>Form and function</h4>\n<h2>Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger: Bottom line</h2>\n<p> </p><div>\n<span>4</span>\n<span>out of 5</span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </div>\n<p>A wireless charger may not be the fastest way to charge up your iPhone, but it can certainly be the most beautiful. Rather than having a loose cable hanging out on your desk or nightstand, you can have this sleek sliver of metal and bamboo. Top off your iPhone while working, or let it charge overnight. The Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger is a great-looking way to charge your iPhone.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fuse-Chicken-Wireless-Charging-FCH-04445/dp/B0792L19T1/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Fuse+Chicken+Gravity+Touch+Wireless+Charger&qid=1569339260&sr=8-1&tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57702YYr\" title=\"\">See at Amazon</a></p>\n<div><div>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-3.jpeg?itok=6J8JtQ9X\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-review\" title=\"Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger review: Bamboo beauty\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/09/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-3.jpeg?itok=6J8JtQ9X\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/09/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-4.jpeg?itok=iUnyb3JT\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-review\" title=\"Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger review: Bamboo beauty\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/09/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-4.jpeg?itok=iUnyb3JT\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-5.jpeg?itok=VxG4uzaY\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-review\" title=\"Fuse Chicken GRAVITY TOUCH Wireless Charger review: Bamboo beauty\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2019/09/fuse-chicken-gravity-touch-wireless-charger-5.jpeg?itok=VxG4uzaY\"></a></div> </div></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/CguYanz6Bto\" height=\"1\">",

They note:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While this payload looks similar to the prior Chrome exploit on the surface, we found it peculiar that eGobbler would still be running outdated exploit code that was fixed months ago, so we recreated our test environment and staged the payload across over two dozen devices and browser versions.\nThis time around however, the iOS Chrome pop-up was not spawning as before, but we were in fact experiencing redirections on WebKit browsers upon the 'onkeydown' event.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This new bug was reported to Chrome and to Apple, the Chrome team submitted a patch to WebKit on August 9, and Apple released a fix on September 19 in iOS 13, and September 24 in Safari 13.0.1 Despite Confiant raising the alarm quickly, they estimate that between August 1 and September 23, 1.16 billion malicious ads were viewed as a result of the flaw.</p>\n<p>The news is proof that security is one of the most important reasons as to why you should try to keep all your software as up to date as possible.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/t70MZ4v1VQQ\" height=\"1\">",

However, since the triple camera is more prone to impacts and scratches than previous models, it's a good idea to provide extra protection. Keep those triple camera lenses shiny and intact with any of the lens protectors above. Our pick is the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Casetego-Compatible-Protector-Transparent-Definition/dp/B07XYY6PTL/?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57999YYr\" title=\"\">Casetego Camera Lens Protector</a> because it offers high-quality tempered glass protection at an excellent price for a pack of nine protectors. Although the tiny protector disks are extremely thin to allow for high-quality photos, they are also scratch and impact resistant.</p>\n<p>For those of you who prefer a one-piece protector and perfect aesthetics, try the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sakulaya-iPhone-Camera-Tempered-Protector/dp/B07XRRLGPR/?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57999YYr\" title=\"\">Sakulaya Camera Lens Protector.</a> It comes in three different colors to match the exact shade of your iPhone 11 Pro Max. For the most robust option possible, however, you may prefer a full-body waterproof case like the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Waterproof-Oterkin-Protective-Shockproof-Underwater/dp/B07XFD64DS/?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57999YYr\" title=\"\">Oterkin</a> for military-grade impact defense and underwater protection.

There are so many franchises and stories that are under the Disney umbrella that it's hard not to be hyped. Not only will we get to rewatch all our favorites, but they will also get further explored through this service. Everything from Marvel to Star Wars, and of course Pixar, have got so much in store for us.</p>\n<p>While we wait for Disney+ to go live on Nov. 12, in the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands and Nov. 19 in Australia and New Zealand, we can make sure that all of our ducks are in a row to stream away when the day comes.</p>\n<p>Part of that process is knowing what internet speed requirements are going to be necessary to use the service. While we don't have anything official from Disney just yet in terms of technical requirements, we can use what another top tier service does require to help us out. <a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306\">Netflix</a> has a nice breakdown of the recommended speeds to get started streaming.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>1.5 Mbps</strong> - This will get you very low-quality video (240p or 320p)</li>\n<li><strong>3.0 Mbps</strong> - Recommended for SD quality (480p)</li>\n<li><strong>5.0 Mbps</strong> - Recommended for HD quality (1080p)</li>\n<li><strong>25 Mbps</strong> - Recommended for Ultra HD quality (4K)</li>\n</ul><p>On Netflix's chart there is an option for slower speeds than 1.5 Mbps at 0.5 Mbps, but that will make the media borderline unwatchable.</p>\n<h3>Can I improve my speeds?</h3>\n<p>Most of the time if you are at home or on Wi-Fi somewhere you'll get speeds high enough to get at least SD quality streaming. Aside from better speeds typically found via Wi-Fi, the signal is generally more stable, which keeps buffering to a minimal.</p>\n<p>When Wi-Fi isn't available and you're pulling signals in on your mobile device to stream, you're going to want to be sure you're on LTE. While you may be able to get by with a strong 3G connection, you'll get lower quality video and far more stutters in your stream. If you seem to have a strong internet connection but there's still buffering, you can do a speed test through <a href=\"https://fast.com/\">Fast</a> and see what you are currently getting. You can also check with your internet service provider (ISP) to see what plan you are on and what speeds you can expect.</p>\n<p>Again, these requirements are being pulled from what Netflix requires \u2014 not Disney+ \u2014 so these could change, but these will be a good benchmark to get started. While we do know a lot of <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus\">what is coming with Disney+</a>, there are a few technical aspects that aren't official, yet. We'll be sure to update you when we have more information.</p>\n\n<h2>No mousing around</h2>\n<h3>Disney+</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-internet-speed-do-you-need-disney-plus\" title=\"What internet speed do you need for Disney+?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/disney-plus-logo-clear-11q4.png\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.disneyplus.com/\" title=\"\">From $7/mo at Disney+</a></p>\n<p>I 'Tink' this is going to be fun</p>\n<p>Disney+ is the first service that will have everything Disney offers in one place.

At the time the cable was being hand-built with only a few available at $200 apiece. But things have moved on since then, and they're now being mass-produced.</p>\n<p>In a conversation with <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kx5nk/fake-apple-lightning-cable-hacks-your-computer-omg-cable-mass-produced-sold\">Vice</a> the inventor of the cable said that the first cable was successfully made in a factory in recent days. And according to his tweets, he's going to put the cables up for sale, too. The person, going by the name MG, calls the cables O.MG Cables and potential customers can sign up to be notified <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1178150751593349120\">when they're available</a> to buy.</p>\n<p>As their online store says, this cable can give people remote access to a computer once it has been plugged in. Attackers can then run remote commands and access files, too. MG boasts that &quot;it's like being able to sit at the keyboard and mouse of the victim but without actually being there&quot;.</p>\n<p>The cable itself looks like a genuine Apple cable and we suspect the vast majority of people wouldn't know any different. But once it's connected, the possibilities are a concern. MG also suggests there are more features to come, too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The O.MG Cable allows new payloads to be created, saved, and transmitted entirely remotely. The cable is built with Red Teams in mind with features like additional boot payloads, no USB enumeration until payload execution, and the ability to forensically erase the firmware, which causes the cable to fall entirely back to an innocuous state. And these are just the features that have been revealed so far.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The site doesn't mention how much the cables will sell for, but the fact that MG doesn't appear to be selective about who they're sold to does open the door to them being picked up by bad actors, rather than security researchers.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/Smf3mQkYBGk\" height=\"1\">",

At the time the cable was being hand-built with only a few available at $200 apiece. But things have moved on since then, and they're now being mass-produced.\nIn a conversation with Vice the inventor of the cable said that the first cable was successfully made in a factory in recent days. And according to his tweets, he's going to put the cables up for sale, too. The person, going by the name MG, calls the cables O.MG Cables and potential customers can sign up to be notified when they're available to buy.\nAs their online store says, this cable can give people remote access to a computer once it has been plugged in....",

While the game is easy to hop into, there are aspects of it that can be done a certain way to help you maximize your game time and the XP you earn.</p>\n<p>Here at iMore, we've been playing since the game released and we've been working on tips and tricks to help you as you start your Wizards Unite Journey. This list is not exhaustive; we will keep adding to it as we find out new things to help you beat the Calamity!</p>\n<h2>Play during events!</h2>\n<p>This is our biggest tip to anyone playing Harry Potter: Wizards Unite because not only is it a fantastic way to gain XP, Runestones, new Foundables, and those elusive Restricted Books, it's also a ton of fun to discover everything new. Plus, you'll have a new page in the Registry to fill out, so it's a nice break from the usual daily grind that you see each and every day.</p>\n<p>There are currently no new events or community days scheduled. We will update this section as we learn more.</p>\n<h2>Masterful casts give you more XP!</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/hpwu-spell-miss.jpg?itok=4PaJ38iE\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/hpwu-spell-motion.jpg?itok=Ya6A4Pok\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/hpwu-combat-masterful.jpg?itok=N40KogdV\"></a></p>\n<p>Casting spells in Wizards Unite is your bread and butter. Learning to cast spells well will help you defeat Confoundables quicker, gain more XP from your battle, and use less energy on each battle.</p>\n<p>The key to overpowering Confoundables and returning Foundables before they get away is to cast <strong>Masterful</strong> spells (Fair > Good > Great > Masterful is the order from worst to best). Masterful casts also net you <strong>100 XP</strong> on top of everything else (Good and Great also get you experience bonuses, but Fair does not). A Masterful cast doesn't guarantee you will overpower the Confoundables; however, it definitely increases your odds.</p>\n<p>Casting Masterful spells can be a little tricky, but the key is trying to be as fast as possible, while also tracing the spell glyph accurately.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-cast-masterful-spells-harry-potter-wizards-unite\" title=\"\">Tips to casting Masterful spells in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a></p>\n\n<h2>Sign in every day</h2>\n<p>Obviously, you should play the game as much as possible if you want to level up quickly and explore the entire world of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite; however, some days you may not be as lucky and have the time to get out and walk around.</p>\n<p>The good news is the game gives you a daily bonus every day you load up the game, so at the very least, even if you can't play the game, you should load the game every day to earn XP, gold, ingredients, potions, and more goodies!</p>\n<h2>Complete daily tasks</h2>\n<p>The daily assignments may seem like a chore to do but they will help you level up and get those all-important potions and ingredients faster. There are four types of assignments in Wizards Unite \u2014 daily assignments, special assignments, achievements, and SOS assignments \u2014 and they can be found in the lower right corner of the world map screen.</p>\n<p>By concentrating on completing these assignments you can add a lot of XP to your daily pool. They can also give you 10-15 gold a day which can be used to purchase items in Diagon Alley, as well as some extra potions to help you succeed. The daily assignments reset, you guessed it, daily, but the rest of them are ongoing and offer greater rewards when you complete them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-level-fast-harry-potter-wizards-unite\" title=\"\">Fastest ways to level up in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a></p>\n<h2>Get the traces with beams of light</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/hpwu-high-value.jpg?itok=e00H4Hqt\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/hpwu-combat-vampire.jpg?itok=oDeLyTh8\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/hpwu-combat-vampire-win.jpg?itok=_svwcV18\"></a></p>\n<p>Keep your eyes peeled for a beam of light shooting up from the Traces you see in the world, these are high-risk Foundables, and as such are worthy of your time. High risk always means high reward and to finish out your registry you will need to find as many rare Foundables as possible.</p>\n<p>The color of the beam of light coming from the Trace is also important, as it represents the difficulty. If it's yellow, that Foundable will be moderately hard to retrieve. Alternatively, if the beam of light is red that means it the Foundable will be extremely difficult to release. Remember to use Exstimulo Potions to help you conquer difficult Confoundables.</p>\n<h3>Use a Tonic for Trace Detection if you're not getting spawns</h3>\n<p>Niantic added a new potion recently, the Tonic for Trace Detection. This pink drink acts like your own private Dark Detector, so it will increase the appearance of Traces for you for 30 minutes. The spawns that this brings up are only seen by you and no one else, so friends won't be able to benefit from it, unlike a Dark Detector.</p>\n<h2>Play at night to find Oddities</h2>\n<p>Oddities are some of the rarest and most difficult Foundables to find and you can only find them at night, so make sure you playing in the evening (between the hours of 8 PM - 8 AM your local time) to ensure you're finding Oddities.</p>\n<p>Oddities work a little differently than normal Foundables, you actually have to battle them just like a Wizarding Challenge, so make sure you have Healing potions, Exstimulo potions and a good amount of Spell Energy before you take them on!</p>\n<p>Speaking of Oddities, there are certain ones that appear at specific times, or certain biomes. For example, Doxies will only appear around dawn, Vampires at night, and Werewolves during full moons. The Horned Serpent also seems to spawn in areas that receive heavy rainfall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-to-find-oddities-harry-potter-wizards-unite\" title=\"\">How to find Oddities in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a></p>\n\n<h2>Keep stocked up on Spell Energy</h2>\n<p>You need Spell Energy to do almost everything in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and unless you buy more, your capacity maxes out at 75. Do your best to visit Inns and Greenhouses as much as possible well you're walking around to ensure you never run out of Spell Energy.</p>\n<p>This is especially important for Wizarding Challenges at Fortresses because they use a lot of Spell Energy to complete. Fortresses are tough, with multiple battles inside, and if you aren't able to complete them you'll have to forfeit, thereby losing your runestone, or having to pay 100 gold to grab 50 energy. Gold is scarce and you really don't want to waste it on energy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/fastest-and-cheapest-ways-get-spell-energy-harry-potter-wizards-unite\" title=\"\">Fastest and cheapest ways to get Spell Energy Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a></p>\n<h3>Different color Inns can offer better Spell Energy</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/wizards-unite-fortresses-crop.jpg?itok=LdoKW5cv\"></a></p>\n<p>Not all innkeepers in Wizards Unite are as generous as others. Sure, they all agreed to feed you for free, but some only offer jellybeans and soy sauce. It's important that if you do find an Inn that offers turkey dinners you use it as much as possible.</p>\n<p>When you first enter an Inn the dishes open briefly, allowing you to see what they have to offer. Any time you see an Inn with three or more turkey dinners, spend a little time there finding Traces and stockpiling your energy. Each turkey dinner gives you 10 spell energy, so instead of running around looking for Inns that may or may not offer something good, stay put and reap the harvest.</p>\n<p>Each Inn takes five minutes to cook new food, so remember to set an alarm so you can harvest them as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>Lastly, keep an eye out for the smoke on Inns and Flags on Greenhouses. If you see either of those things, it means you have already visited them and they aren't ready to be used again. As soon as the smoke clears and the flags lower you are clear to go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-what-are-inns-and-how-do-they-work\" title=\"\">Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: What are Inns and how do they work?</a></p>\n<h3>Always pick up at least one ingredient every day</h3>\n<p>One of the daily tasks that you need to do is pick up a single ingredient or Portkey Portmanteau on the map, and even if you don't play a lot, doing this will always gaurantee you 10 Spell Energy every day. It's super easy to complete the task, and boom, 10 free energy! So even if you live in a rural area, doing at least this single task every day will get you a nice amount of energy. Save it up and then you'll be ready to play for the next big event, since you can go over your energy alotment when getting it as rewards.</p>\n\n<h2>How to beat Wizarding Challenges</h2>\n<p>Fortresses are host to Wizarding Challenges and they are a whole different ball game. They require a lot more thought and finesse than you might think. That's why we have a whole guide dedicated to defeating Wizarding Challenges!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-complete-wizarding-challenges-harry-potter-wizards-unite\" title=\"\">Harry Potter: Wizards Unite - Wizarding Challenge Tips &amp; Tricks</a></p>\n<h2>Make sure you manage your ingredient inventory</h2>\n<p>You only have a certain amount of room for all your potion ingredients \u2014 200 is maximum capacity \u2014 and if you're full you won't be able to pick any up from the map or receive any as rewards. This means you could be missing out on some rarer ingredients.</p>\n<p>Make sure you are not filling your vault up with common ingredients until you reach the maximum You can delete ingredients easily enough and you can always buy more space for 425 Gold, though Gold costs real money so proceed with caution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/which-ingredients-are-worth-saving-harry-potter-wizards-unite\" title=\"\">Which ingredients are worth saving in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a></p>\n<h2>Start off with lower level Runestones</h2>\n<p>The farther you go in the Fortresses, the tougher the foes will be in the Wizarding Challenges. If you feel that enemies are too difficult for you, then try a lower-level runestone. You'll still get the rewards for the type of runestone that you use, but the lower level ones won't be as difficult to overcome. If you're with high level friends, then use a higher level runestone to reap maximum rewards.</p>\n<h2>Get those red books</h2>\n<p>Wizarding Challenges are the main way to obtain Red Books, which you need to upgrade your profession's skills. In some ways, they're more important than Restricted Books, which are easy to come by just by participating in events. But Red Books can only be obtained by Challenges, and sometimes you'll get them as daily log in rewards, so make sure you're doing Challenges. It benefits you to upgrade those skills.</p>\n<h2>Constantly upgrade your skills</h2>\n<p>As soon as you see the red dot on your Profession tab, you should look into what skills you can level up. The more you upgrade your skills and abilities, the easier Challenges become. No foe shall stand before you once you max out your profession's tree.</p>\n<h2>Use your gold key on 2KM Portmanteaus</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/05/hpwu-7km-portkey.jpg?itok=6k3dVbrh\"></a></p>\n<p>A portmanteau is Wizards Unite version of an egg in Pok\u00e9mon Go. You walk around with them until they are ready to open and inside they have a stand-alone battle with Foundables that are only available in Portkeys. These Portmanteaus come in 2KM, 5KM, 10KM, and sometimes special 7KM versions, and each one requires a key to open.</p>\n<p>You get one gold key to use on your Portmanteaus and that gold key lasts forever, unlike silver keys, which are single use. Try to use your gold key on 2KM Portmanteau's to maximize its use. Save your Silver keys (which you earn by leveling up) to open 5KM or 10KM Portmanteaus. Obviously, the more Portmanteaus you can open with it in the shortest time, the better.</p>\n<h2>Stockpile your Portkeys and use a Baruffio's Brain Elixir to maximize XP</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/baruffiosbrainelixir.png?itok=_ENGFc5e\"></a></p>\n<p>The Baruffio's Brain Elixir in Wizards Unite is incredibly helpful as it gives you double Wizarding XP from Traces, Wizarding Challenges, <strong>and</strong> Portkeys. Any time you open a Portkey you should try to do it in conjunction with a Baruffio's Brain Elixir.</p>\n<p>Lory, the EIC of this fine site, has another idea to make the Brain Elixir even more potent: <em>&quot;Set multiple Portmanteaus to unlock at the same time, so the brain elixir gives extra XP for all.&quot;</em> To do this Lory recommends staggering the timing of when you put the key in the Portmanteau.</p>\n<p>Here's an example: You have a 10KM Portmanteau, a 5KM one, and a 2KM one. You want to put a key in the 10KM one then walk it for 5KM. Once you reach the 5KM mark you should put the key in the 5KM portmanteau. Now the two will be ready at the same time. When both of them reach the 8 km mark put your gold key in the 2KM Portmanteau and you will have three ready to go in just 2 km.</p>\n<p>Once they are all ready to go you can drink your Baruffio's Brain Elixir and unlock them, gaining the double XP for all three of them at the same time. Really, all it takes is a little forward planning and you can really maximize your Portmanteaus.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can also just stockpile Portkeys until you have the maximum amount \u2014 eight \u2014 and then drink a Baruffio's Brain Elixir to get a load of XP at once!</p>\n\n<h2>Brew potions using Master Notes</h2>\n<p>On the subject of potions, brewing potions in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite takes time, but you can reduce this time by using Master Notes.</p>\n<p>Master Notes are gestures, specific to each different potion you can make, that cut the brewing time by 15%. You draw the shapes of a given sequence into the cauldron after tapping the wooden spoon. The shapes will appear above the cauldron as you make each pattern. Enter the wrong gesture, and your entire sequence is deleted, but you can try as many times as you need to in order to get it right.</p>\n<p>Another nice thing about Master Notes is that they reduce the <strong>total time</strong> to brew by 15%, <em>not</em> the remaining time. This means if you input the Master Notes sequence when there is 15% or less time remaining on a potion, it will <strong>complete instantly</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/wizards-united-master-notes\" title=\"\">How to brew every potion with Master Notes in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite!</a></p>\n<h2>Brew and buy is cheaper than buying</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite: Tips and tricks for October 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/07/hpwu-healingpotion.png?itok=r7vXpcfq\"></a></p>\n<p>If you are looking to fight some fortresses but find yourself low on health potions you can always buy them from Diagon Alley for 25 gold, or, if you have the ingredients available there is a cheaper way.</p>\n<p>Speeding up health potion production once you start brewing only costs 12 gold per potion \u2014 essentially half price compared to Diagon Alley \u2014 so you can grab four potions really quickly with minimal fuss. Of course, you will need the ingredients to brew the potions, but in my experience, there is always enough around to brew a health potion or two.</p>\n<h2>Spend your gold wisely</h2>\n<p>Gold is the in-game currency in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, which you can get by playing the game or by spending real money to buy it. Whichever option you choose, makes sure you are spending your gold wisely, because once you do, it's gone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/fastest-ways-get-game-gold-harry-potter-wizards-unite\" title=\"\">Fastest ways to get in-game gold in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a></p>\n<h2>What tricks have you found?</h2>\n<p>Have you found helpful tricks as you've been playing?

The potential shown by Apple's growing services business is also a contributing factor, says Maurer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Recently, there have been a number of positive notes out from street analysts that have helped the stock move higher. For example, Jefferies came out changing its rating from Neutral to Buy. But it also raised its price target by a whopping $50 to $260, primarily citing a strong iPhone brand and the massive opportunity for services growth ahead. JPMorgan also raised its price target to a street high $265 on good sales momentum for the iPhone 11 line, with the potential for another off-cycle new phone launch next spring that could be quite important as I previously discussed. Finally, Evercore came out with a note this week discussing the potential for iPhone upside, keeping an Outperform rating and $247 price target.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maurer also notes that the ongoing tensions between the United States and China could impact Apple's stock price in the coming weeks. It's all down to tariffs and whether they're delayed once again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With four weeks until earnings, it is definitely possible that Apple shares hit a new high before the report. I think the most plausible scenario where that occurs is an easing of trade tensions between the US and China. The two countries are scheduled to meet again this month, and tariffs that were previously supposed to start on October 1st were pushed back to the 15th. If that date gets pushed back again, or we see a delay of the next round of tariffs slated to start in December that features even more Apple products, the market likely will react in a very positive way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apple shares sat at $224.59 at the time of writing which is around $5 off the number needed to give Apple a new all-time high share price. As <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/656366/apple-shares-could-be-about-to-hit-a-new-all-time-high/\">Cult of Mac</a> notes, the current numbers give Apple a market cap of $1.015 trillian, making it one of the most valuable businesses on the planet.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/AXAYNvdozsQ\" height=\"1\">",

For example, if an iPhone user always messages another person via WhatsApp, Siri will automatically launch WhatsApp, rather than iMessage. It will decide which service to use based on interactions with specific contacts. Developers will need to enable the new Siri functionality in their apps. This will be expanded later to phone apps for calls as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This will mean that in future, if you ask Siri to send a message, it will default to the messaging app that you use the most, rather than defaulting to iMessage as is currently the case.

So in the meantime, if you know someone who is interested in installing League of Legends, they should do so before Catalina debuts in October OR not update their macOS to Catalina until they do.</p>\n<p>We do not currently have an estimated timeline for when Catalina will be able to support League of Legends, but we will update players as we get a clearer look at its release date.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's important to note that this could affect both League of Legends and spinoff Teamfight Tactics, which requires the LoL client in order to play. To recap, the issue will <strong>not</strong> affect any players who already have the game installed. So, if you are a LoL player with the game installed, there's nothing to worry about. If you're about to jump into the game for the first time on Mac, Riot strongly recommends that you should download the game before you install macOS Catalina (whenever that is released).</p>\n<p>As noted by Riot, it is unclear at this stage whether this is going to be an issue when Catalina is released. It is also unclear at this stage how long the problem might persist if indeed it does take effect. Most recent reports suggest Catalina <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apples-danish-website-suggests-macos-catalina-launching-october-4\">could be released Friday, October 4</a>, however Apple is yet to confirm a release date.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/JWyLk-_b5BM\" height=\"1\">",

Typing in any keyword will bring up results for Twitter user names, their informal names and conversation content much the same way searching through your iMessages does on iOS. This means you can now track down any direct message conversation you've had on Twitter b...",

Keeping the viewfinder clear of any\nobstructions is one of our highest priorities.</p>\n<p>It works similarly, too, at first glance: just keep tapping to\ncycle between 1x, 2x, and 0.5x sizes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, switching cameras has a bit of a delay. If you\u2019re\ncomposing a shot and want to compare the 0.5x and 1x lenses,\ncycling past that 2x lens feels slow and clunky. No sweat. Haptic\ntouch (or in common parlance, long press) the lens button to bring\nup our lens switcher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a really clever bit of UI, very well-implemented.

But Sebastiaan de With\u2009\u2014\u2009co-creator of the excellent iPhone camera app Halide\u2009\u2014\u2009<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1178472295989276672\">pointed out on Twitter</a> that Night Mode only works with the regular wide-angle lens. You can shoot with 2\u00d7 zoom with Night Mode, but when you do, it uses the wide angle camera and digitally, rather than optically, zooms to the 2\u00d7 field of view.</p>\n<p>You can see this yourself in the EXIF data. Shoot an image using Night Mode at 2\u00d7 zoom, and look at the lens information in Photos on the Mac. It will say \u201ciPhone 11 Pro back triple camera 4.25mm f/1.8\u201d. That\u2019s the wide-angle camera. The telephoto camera is \u201c6mm f/2\u201d, and the ultra-wide is \u201c1.54mm f/2.4\u201d. (The front-facing camera is \u201c2.71mm f/2.2\u201d.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s even easier to see it for yourself by simply obscuring the lenses one at a time with a fingertip or piece of paper. Cover the telephoto and you can still shoot \u201c2\u00d7\u201d Night Mode shots; cover the regular wide lens and you can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>0.5\u00d7 always uses the ultra-wide camera, because you can\u2019t get that field of view otherwise. 1\u00d7 always uses the wide angle, because that camera has the best sensor and fastest lens. But 2\u00d7 doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re always using the telephoto camera\u2009\u2014\u2009in low light it will use the wide-angle camera and digital zoom. Previous iPhones with dual camera systems have done the same thing in low light conditions, but a lot of us\u2009\u2014\u2009myself included\u2009\u2014\u2009made the wrong assumption about Night Mode and \u201c2\u00d7 zoom\u201d.</p>\n<p>It occurs to me that this is why Apple has been somewhat obfuscatory about Night Mode working only with the regular wide angle camera, despite being very forthcoming about explaining other technical details (like Deep Fusion) at great length: it means the iPhone 11 can shoot the <em>exact</em> same \u201c2\u00d7\u201d Night Mode shots as the iPhone 11 Pro, because on both phones 2\u00d7 Night Mode shots are cropped and digitally zoomed from the 1\u00d7 camera sensor. There\u2019s nothing scandalous about this\u2009\u2014\u2009everyone loves Night Mode, including for 2x field-of-view photos. But it\u2019s yet another way that the iPhone 11 is the technical equal to the significantly more expensive 11 Pro.</p>"

A good old fashioned playground bully.</p>\n<p>I have mostly kept this story to myself for over a year, but I don\u2019t feel I can continue to do so. It is destroying my peace of mind and making me feel terrible. I tried to ignore my feelings about this, hoping they would go away, but they have not. I need to share my story in order to move on from this.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not posting this because I want anyone to do anything about this specific incident. I just want people to listen and to understand. </p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>My first interaction with my bully was back in 2015. 2015 was the first year I really got into conference speaking. I had finished up school the year before and conference speaking was the only way I had to network and get my name out there in order to find a job.</p>\n<p>I was invited to speak at a conference in 2015 by a friend of mine. As many of you know, I used to be in an abusive marriage. My previous husband would not allow me to have money to buy textbooks while I was going to school for computer programming. My friend sent me books, watched my first shitty conference talk while it was being live streamed, and used his connections to try to help me find a job.</p>\n<p>My friend did this when I was nobody. I wasn\u2019t an author yet. I didn\u2019t have a blog. No one knew who I was. He helped me because it was a kind thing to do and he had no expectation that I would ever become anything. To me, the way someone treats you when they don\u2019t get any benefit from it means a lot. I see way too many people who only network with people who are more visible than they are and tell anyone just starting out to fuck off. I don\u2019t like those people.</p>\n<p>I was invited to speak at a conference my friend was organizing, but I could not make it because I found out my ex-husband had put us significantly in debt. I felt very sad about not being able to go.</p>\n<p>My friend also invited my bully to the conference. My bully could not go for different reasons than I had. They were very vocal about how unhappy they were with my friend regarding his handling of his conference. They started a Twitter mob against my friend and started a whisper network around him.</p>\n<p>I felt some loyalty to my friend after his working to help me before I had a career. I kept hearing people at conferences say how terrible it was that he was being attacked, but no one said anything. I was probably dumb, but I put my neck out to defend my friend because no one else would. I understood that my bully would be unhappy about my defense and I really did the best I could to say this whole thing was probably a misunderstanding, as is wont to happen when people communicate online.</p>\n<p>After I posted that post, the talk stopped. I thought I made a difference and got people to leave him alone. I now realize it\u2019s probable that people were still talking about him, but that I had shown myself to be untrustworthy and thus no one included me in these conversations.</p>\n<p>I knew there would probably be repercussions for my actions, but I figured I did the right thing and I would feel morally okay with whatever the blowback was.</p>\n<h2>2018</h2>\n<p>Four years passed and I didn\u2019t feel the blowback. I noticed I was never invited to a conference my bully was speaking at, but that was fine. I didn\u2019t really care to interact with them. </p>\n<p>My luck ran out in 2018.</p>\n<p>A talk of mine was accepted at a conference. I had to spend nine months working on it. It was incredibly labor intensive, but I was happy to have the opportunity to speak.</p>\n<p>Three weeks before the conference, I saw that the conference organizers announced my bully would be a keynote speaker at the conference.</p>\n<p>I wrestled with what to do. I hadn\u2019t had any contact with my bully in four years. I half hoped my bully had forgotten the whole incident and found someone else to be mad at about something. I thought about approaching the conference organizers about the situation, but I thought that would be petty. My bully hadn\u2019t done anything so what would I complain about? What could they even do about it?</p>\n<p>I found out.</p>\n<p>Six days before the conference I was contacted on the conference Slack by the organizers telling me that they had to talk to me and had set a meeting for 10:00 the following morning. I kind of joked that I hoped I hadn\u2019t done something wrong. They repeated that I was required to speak to them tomorrow morning at 10:00. They would not elaborate what had happened or what we would be speaking about. I had a sinking feeling this was about my bully. I was right.</p>\n<p>The organizers, looking like police interrogators, told me there had been a complaint about me. They said they did not want to hear my side of the story because they didn\u2019t care and would not believe me. They told me they had stringent conditions I was required to follow if I was to be allowed to keep my slot at their conference:</p>\n<ul><li>I was not to be within 500 feet of my bully</li><li>I was not to be in the same room as my bully</li><li>I was not to speak to my bully</li><li>I was not to speak about my bully to anyone at the conference</li><li>I was not to attend a networking event my bully wanted to attend</li><li>I was not to tell anyone that this conversation happened</li></ul>\n<p>I was dumbstruck. I was not surprised my bully had complained about me. I was surprised at how I was being treated by the organizers. I considered them to be friends. I had had them to my house and they had slept under my roof. They met my parents and I had fed them food I made myself. I considered this to be a deep transgression of my hospitality and relationship with them.</p>\n<p>My initial inclination was to tell them to fuck off and that I would not attend their conference. I felt that this would have looked bad professionally. I spent nine months working on my talk and it could not be replaced easily. I was also bringing my now-husband with me. He had bought a conference and a plane ticket. I didn\u2019t feel I could tell him that he wasted that money because I was being petty.</p>\n<p>So I swallowed my pride and faked my way through the conference. I spent most of the conference hiding in my room with my husband. I came out for my talks and for meals. I briefly saw my bully as I was taking my dog outside to walk her and I was terrified that they would complain about me violating the terms of my parole and have me kicked out before I could give my talk.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing that bothers me about this situation is that I had reported harassment two years earlier, the first time I attended their conference. Someone at the conference touched me inappropriately and tried to get me to take them back to my hotel room to have sex. I reported the incident and they didn\u2019t believe me. They told me it was a misunderstanding, the perpetrator was European, and that I had misunderstood his intentions. I had to physically demonstrate on one of the organizers how I had been touched for them to take it seriously.</p>\n<p>So like sexual assault is just fine, but just make sure you don\u2019t defend someone on Twitter? I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anyone about that incident either. My bad.</p>\n<h2>Aftermath</h2>\n<p>I tried to tell myself that none of this is important and that I didn\u2019t care. I felt deeply foolish for thinking these people were my friends when they clearly didn\u2019t feel that way about me. I felt like I had been conned and was too stupid to realize it until it was too late. I was angry about the number of hours I wasted working on their projects and I wanted that time back.</p>\n<p>I broke my agreement to not talk about this incident a few times with a few trusted friends in the community. Any time I tried to obscure the name of my bully, they always immediately knew who it was. No one I told was surprised any of this happened. They were always deeply sympathetic and told me that everyone knows how this person is.</p>\n<p>Imagine my shock to see my confidants going out of their way to socialize and interact with my bully. I would see them having long involved conversations on Twitter or being asked to collaborate on their side projects.</p>\n<p>I called one of them out about this. I reminded him about how I had been treated. His response was, \u201cYeah, but that has nothing to do with me. I can be friend with both of you and be Jonny in the Middle because I\u2019m basically Switzerland.\u201d</p>\n<p>At first I tried not to let this bother me. I didn\u2019t want to tell my friends they had to choose between me and a bully because that seemed shrewish. Also mostly because I know that my side would not be chosen. But the longer this goes on, the more this bothers me.</p>\n<p>All of these people know this person is a bully. They know this person\u2019s behavior is terrible. Conference organizers know that this person will ruin them on Twitter if they don\u2019t do everything the bully says. So why do they keep giving my bully a platform? Why do they keep inviting the bully to speak and give them power and visibility? Why do they knowingly stick their neck in a noose and then punish anyone who threatens a situation where it might cut off their air?</p>\n<p>I kept thinking that one day someone would catch wise to this situation and they would stop inviting my bully to speak, but it hasn\u2019t happened. I realized that it\u2019s not because people don\u2019t know this person is a bully. It\u2019s because people don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t care that this person treats people badly because they get something out of interacting with them.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the piece that clicked into place that really made me feel I needed to talk about this. I knew my bully had mental health issues. Not that it\u2019s an excuse for behavior. I don\u2019t blame them for complaining about me to the conference organizers. I expected them to. I would not be surprised if my bully used their clout to keep me away from any conference they were at for so many years.</p>\n<p>The people I do blame are the ones who know this is happening and do nothing.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how I can continue to be friends with people who knowingly associate themselves with an abusive bully. I don\u2019t know how they can feel that it\u2019s okay for someone to ruin people\u2019s lives as long as it\u2019s not theirs.</p>\n<p>I also keep thinking about how this was how I was treated when <strong>I WAS A SPEAKER!!</strong> I keep thinking of all the people this bully might have damaged who didn\u2019t have the clout/visibility I do. What if I had been an attendee? A student? How many people have had their careers damaged or left the community because they ran afoul of this person? We\u2019ll never know.</p>\n<h2>What Do I Want Out of This?</h2>\n<p>Here is what I <strong>DON\u2019T</strong> want out of this:</p>\n<ul><li>I don\u2019t want anyone who figured out who these people are to harass them on Twitter in any capacity. That\u2019s their MO, not mine.</li><li>I don\u2019t want to start a feud. This is about me talking about my feelings, not trying to start some kind of retribution against anyone. I\u2019m not trying to damage anyone\u2019s business/living because I feel slighted. I just want to be able to speak openly about how this made me feel.</li><li>I don\u2019t want an apology. The organizers made a calculated risk that they could treat me like shit and have nothing bad happen to them because I have no power to make their lives miserable and they were right. That burns me up a little, but it\u2019s reality. I don\u2019t want a fake apology from anyone trying to make themselves look better. The bridge is burned and it\u2019s not coming back.</li></ul>\n<p>I do want two things out of this. The first thing is I just want to talk about how this made me feel. I feel deeply angry and hurt by this situation. I have bottled this up for over a year and I am tired of it. I kept telling myself I had no right to feel upset about this because there are kids locked in concentration camps along the border and the world is slowly microwaving to death. Being slighted at a conference is the most First World Problem there is. Also, I may be in the wrong here. What if I did something terrible and I was told not to tell because it would look bad for me? I know I should get over this and if I just keep trying to be a good person and ship projects that in the long run this doesn\u2019t matter. But I feel I have the right to my anger and my pain regarding this.</p>\n<p>I want to be clear that I didn\u2019t expect the organizers to tell my bully to fuck off. I was pretty sure my bully would complain about me, but I wish the organizers had handled their interaction with me differently. Instead of treating me like a pedophile caught next to a playground, I wish they had privately reached out and been like, \u201cHey, look. Someone complained about you. We know you\u2019re cool. Do you mind just like avoiding them so that they don\u2019t cause an incident?\u201d I would have been like, sure, no problem. See you next week. They chose instead to completely burn our entire personal and professional relationship. It wasn\u2019t necessary. They chose to do it. That kind of stings.</p>\n<p>I want to get over this. This is a festering wound that never heals and constantly reopens over nothing. I don\u2019t trust people who were my friends. I don\u2019t feel comfortable or trust anyone anymore. I am consumed with a desire to become so powerful that no one can ever fuck me over like this again. I hate feeling this way. I want to build things that make me happy. I want this to not bother me anymore.</p>\n<p>The second thing I want out of this is for people to realize there is no neutral position in a situation where someone is being bullied or harassed. If someone is being bullied because they disagreed with another person\u2019s behavior towards someone else and they are being harassed, you don\u2019t get to sit there and think, \u201cSucks to be them! Should have keep their mouth shut!\u201d and still be a good person. </p>\n<p>There is a somewhat large subset of people on Twitter who feel that any kind of disagreement with them constitutes harassment. It does not. Hating someone isn\u2019t justification for complaining about their presence at a professional event.</p>\n<h2>How to Handle Bullying</h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a handy guide to dealing with bullying.</p>\n<p>If you see someone being harassed, you gently insert yourself into the conversation and you tell the harasser that their behavior is inappropriate. The harasser must back off and apologize and the incident is over. There is no retaliation or blame from either party. It\u2019s just over.</p>\n<p>If you see someone try to step between a harasser and someone else who is also being harassed, you don\u2019t sit back smugly and think they should have kept to themselves. You step in and also assert that this behavior isn\u2019t acceptable.</p>\n<p>This works even in the situations where people are afraid of being called out as creepy or socially awkward. If you are bothering someone and you don\u2019t mean to, the person just wants the behavior to stop. Someone lets you know that you are bothering another person, you apologize, and you leave them alone. Kindergartners understand this. Had I been asked to apologize to my bully but be allowed free range of the conference, I would have been happy to do so. But the point was retribution not fear.</p>\n<p>Bullies are allowed to act the way they do because most people sit back and let it happen because they figure it\u2019s nothing to do with them. It is to do with you. If you sit back and let people behave this way, you\u2019re contributing to a hostile environment. Your friends see when you sit back and let them be treated like crap. They remember. They pretend it doesn\u2019t hurt them when you tell them later that what happened sucked but you didn\u2019t want to get involved, but it does. You are hurting your friends when you let them be harassed.</p>\n<p>We can\u2019t do anything about the concentration camps along the border or the inevitable heat death of the Universe, but god damn it, we can make our community a little bit more welcoming and friendly place for everyone.</p>"

It's confusing.</p>\n<p>In November 2018, Cloudflare <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/cloudflare-launches-1111-mobile-app-its-dns-service\">introduced its 1.1.1.1 application</a>. It was a simple app that could move your phone's networking stack to use Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service instead of the one assigned by your internet service provider. Google does something very similar with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/\">its own public DNS service</a>, but Cloudflare's is faster so it made your connections feel more &quot;instant.&quot; The announcement also talked about something called WARP, which would be coming at a later date.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WARP is part of Cloudflare's existing app and not a standalone service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-warp-plus/\">That later date has arrived</a>, and WARP is now part of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone\">the 1.1.1.1 app</a>. So far, not too confusing, but that changes when the term VPN enters the fray. WARP is a VPN, but WARP isn't like any VPN you might be using now or have heard about.</p>\n<h2>What is DNS?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-cloudflares-warp-and-should-you-use-it\" title=\"What is Cloudflare's WARP VPN and should you use it?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2017/07/best-vpn-imore-hero-01.jpg?itok=vgFl-X1A\"></a></p>\n<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is used to convert familiar names like www.google.com into IP (Internet Protocol) addresses like 173.194.39.78.</p>\n<p>Your phone (or any other computer) can only connect to anything over the internet using numbers. DNS servers are used to translate the things we type into those numbers so we don't have to memorize them. They're often called the phone book of the internet. These servers, called nameservers, hold files that can look up names like microsoft.com or facebook.com so you can be connected when you type them into your browser or when an app calls for a site to be opened. There is no single computer that holds the billions of DNS records \u2014 instead, they are distributed on many machines all over the globe.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nameservers are the internet's phone book. Remember those?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The way nameservers are mapped means there are machines that hold lookup abilities for each TLD (Top Level Domain), which in turn has its own set of nameservers that has individual records. A TLD is the three letters like &quot;com&quot; or &quot;net&quot; that end a URL you type in.</p>\n<p>So you can imagine just how many different machines are used to look up what we all type and convert it into a string of numbers that our phones and computers can use to actually connect to anything on the internet. You can also imagine that some of these machines are super busy and can be slow. If you've ever typed in a web address and waited for a page to change or load, part of that waiting time was probably for the DNS resolution. Having nameservers that are not only faster but don't track requests, like Google or Cloudflare's offerings, is a really good thing.</p>\n<h2>What is a VPN?</h2>\n<p>You might think a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a network tool that keeps you more private on the internet or lets you access region-restricted content, but those are actually byproducts and not at all what a VPN was designed to do. A VPN was &quot;invented&quot; to allow you a direct and secure connection to a remote network through the internet. An example would be me using a VPN to connect to Mobile Nation's servers from anywhere and having the traffic tunneled through the regular internet without interacting with any of it. That's a real example we use every day, by the way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-vpn-services\" title=\"\">More: Save money with these great VPN deals</a></p>\n<p>A VPN doesn't even have to be encrypted and doesn't even hide your traffic \u2014 it simply changes who can see it. There are many great VPNs that <strong>do</strong> encrypt and anonymize your internet traffic, letting you browse the web privately and access all of its content. But those aren't the only kinds of VPNs and that can be confusing.</p>\n<h2>What is WARP?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-cloudflares-warp-and-should-you-use-it\" title=\"What is Cloudflare's WARP VPN and should you use it?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/665456-cloudflare-warp-logo-1aou.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>WARP is a VPN that doesn't hide your origin IP (where or who you are) but does encrypt your traffic and use Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service. It's rolled into the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone\">1.1.1.1 app</a> and shouldn't be considered a separate thing. The 1.1.1.1 app protects your DNS queries from being &quot;sniffed&quot; on local and unsecured networks, like the Wi-Fi router at your local Starbucks, and when WARP is activated from inside the app it adds a VPN encryption layer that adds to that protection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A VPN can bolster your online privacy, but that wasn't Cloudflare's original intent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is all the 1.1.1.1 app does, and it's not any good for hiding your location or browsing anonymously. It's not advertised to be either, and the terms of service even tell you that your original IP (the one your ISP gave you) is being reported to Cloudflare servers. Cloudflare also says it keeps that data for two years and never sells any of it.</p>\n<p>1.1.1.1 with WARP is free to use, but Cloudflare also offers a premium package called WARP+. WARP+ offers the same features as the free version with one handy extra \u2014 requests over the internet are routed through Cloudflare's network. Using a feature known as Argo Smart Routing, WARP+ can make sure the things you want to see aren't affected by network congestion. WARP+ pricing varies slightly based on location, which Cloudflare says was done to make sure it matches the cost of a Big Mac.</p>\n<p>If this isn't what you're looking for, don't use Cloudflare's DNS and instead use the one your ISP provides or Google's in tandem with another VPN product. There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-vpn-services\">great ones to choose from</a>.</p>\n<h2>Should I use this?</h2>\n<p>It's not going to hurt anything and it's not doing anything &quot;bad&quot; regardless of what you might have read on the internet. The problem is that Cloudflare uses the words &quot;VPN&quot; and &quot;not a VPN&quot; interchangeably and that makes the whole thing confusing as heck. Even folks who know how all of this works were a bit confused and had to figure out exactly what Cloudflare was doing and what it was offering with the addition of WARP to the 1.1.1.1 app.</p>\n<p>If you're not concerned about what DNS is or does and how nameservers or encryption work, think of the app as a little extra protection while on the internet, but not any sort of service that can hide your location or identity and you'll have a good handle on it all. Read the terms of service before you give the app the OK to start working and decide if its something you need.</p>\n\n<h4>Warp VPN</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/what-cloudflares-warp-and-should-you-use-it\" title=\"What is Cloudflare's WARP VPN and should you use it?\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/10/warp-render-g7e.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627\" title=\"\">Free at App Store</a></p>\n<p>Cloudflare's VPN isn't a traditional VPN \u2014 it encrypts your data without hiding your origin, so it's not meant to be used to access geographically-restricted content or to get around other restrictions. At its core, it's just meant to make your public browsing safer and faster.</p>\n</div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/RFkBszWe0bk\" height=\"1\">",

It's confusing.\nIn November 2018, Cloudflare introduced its 1.1.1.1 application. It was a simple app that could move your phone's networking stack to use Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service instead of the one assigned by your internet service provider. Google does something very similar with its own public DNS service, but Cloudflare's is faster so it made your connections feel more &quot;instant.&quot; The announcement also talked about something called WARP, which would be coming at a later date.\nWARP is part of Cloudflare's existing app and not a standalone service.\nThat later date has arrived, and WARP is now part of the 1.1.1.1 app. So far, not too confusing, but that changes when the term VPN enters the fray. WARP is a VPN, but WARP isn't like any VPN you might be using now or have heard about.\nWhat is DNS?\nDNS (Domain Name System) is used to convert familiar names like www.google.com int...",

Here's how it does that according to Schiller.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It shoots nine images. Before you press the shutter button, it's already shot four short images [and] four secondary images. When you take the shutter button, it takes one long exposure. And in just one second, the neural engine analyzes the fused combination of long and short images picking the best among them, selecting all the pixels and pixel by pixel, going through 24 million pixels, to optimize for detail and low noise.</p>\n<p>This is the first time a neural engine is responsible for generating the output image. It is computational photography mad science. It's way cool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that was it. Apple didn't get into too much detail as the feature would not be available until a later time.

However, it appears that <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apples-deep-fusion-camera-feature-now-available-ios-13-developer-beta\">Deep Fusion is rolling out in the latest developer beta</a> of iOS 13.2 on iPhone 11 devices, and will be available to everyone with an iPhone 11 soon.</p>\n<p>While Deep Fusion happens automatically and won't be noticeable like Night Mode, it turns out that it won't be enabled if you have the <strong>Capture Outside of Frame</strong> setting turned on (here's <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-use-camera-iphone-11-and-iphone-11-pro#outside-frame\">how to enable Capture Outside of Frame</a> if you missed it). So if you have Capture Outside of Frame turned on, Deep Fusion will not be available, and vice versa.</p>\n<h2>What is Deep Fusion and how will it work?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/youll-need-disable-capture-outside-frame-use-deep-fusion-iphone-11\" title=\"You'll need to disable Capture Outside of Frame to use Deep Fusion on iPhone 11\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphone-11-deep-fusion.jpg?itok=puMFPYhf\"></a></p>\n<p>Deep Fusion is a new computational photography process specifically on the iPhone 11 line because of the A13 chip. It blends together multiple exposures at the pixel level in order to create a photograph with an even higher level of detail than standard HDR. This means even more detailed textures in things like skin, clothing, and foliage.</p>\n<p>Unlike Night Mode, Deep Fusion will happen automatically and we won't even notice it. However, it will only activate in certain situations.</p>\n<p>With the Wide (Normal) lens, Deep Fusion kicks in at just above the 10 lux floor that triggers Night Mode. Whether Night Mode or Deep Fusion activates depends on the lighting source for the current scene. On the Telephoto camera, Deep Fusion will be active in pretty much everything except the brightest situations, as that is when the Smart HDR goes into effect due to the abundance of highlights.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Deep Fusion has the camera shoot a short frame at a negative EV value. This results in a darker image than you would normally like, but it just pulls sharpness from this frame. It also shoots three regular EV0 images and then a long EV+ frame, aligns everything together, and blends all of the images into one.</p>\n<p>You end up with two 12MP images that are combined together in a single 24MP photo. The process to do this uses four separate neural networks, which account for all of the noise characteristics of the camera sensors, as well as the photo subject matter.</p>\n<p>The machine learning process looks at every individual pixel before combining, and it only takes about one second to process everything. Deep Fusion will happen in the background, and you'll never really notice it until you see the images it produces.</p>\n<h2>What is Capture Outside of Frame?</h2>\n<p>Capture Outside of Frame is a setting available on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro that lets you capture content outside of the frame on the viewfinder. This captured content only appears when you make edits to the photo, such as cropping, straightening, rotating, and adjusting perspective. For QuickTake video capture, it helps improve the composition.</p>\n<h2>So why won't Deep Fusion work with Capture Outside of Frame?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/youll-need-disable-capture-outside-frame-use-deep-fusion-iphone-11\" title=\"You'll need to disable Capture Outside of Frame to use Deep Fusion on iPhone 11\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/deep-fusion-sample-2.jpeg?itok=mqP7yfcE\"></a></p>\n<p>The Capture Outside of Frame feature works by utilizing the Ultra Wide camera to capture the rest of the scene outside of the frame. However, Deep Fusion does not work with the Ultra Wide camera due to the lack of focus pixels and optical image stabilization (this is also why Night Mode does not work with the Ultra Wide lens).</p>\n<p>So if you want to compare how effective Deep Fusion is, take a picture with Deep Fusion on, and then turn on Capture Outside of Frame and take the same photo.</p>\n<h2>Are you looking forward to Deep Fusion?</h2>\n<p>We are definitely excited that Deep Fusion is finally starting to roll out, and we eagerly anticipate the final release hopefully soon. Are you looking forward to Deep Fusion or have any questions about it?

So if you have Capture Outside of Frame turned on, Deep Fusion will not be available, and vice versa.\nWhat is Deep Fusion and how will it work?\nDeep Fusion is a new computational photography process specifically on the iPhone 11 line because of the A13 chip.

Here\u2019s a graph of revenue by\nmonth (the last month is September 2019):</p>\n<p><img width=\"500px\" src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/revenue-by-month.png\"></p>\n<p>This adds up to $87,858 USD for 2019 so far, which (depending on what I release in the\nrest of this year) is on track to be similar to revenue for 2018 ($101,558).</p>\n<p>Until quite recently I\u2019d been writing zines in my spare time, and now I\u2019m <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/09/13/a-year-explaining-computer-things/\">taking a year to focus on it</a>.</p>\n<h3>how $30,000 for September breaks down</h3>\n<p>The most obvious thing in that monthly revenue graph above is that 2 months\n(September and March) have way more revenue than all the others. This is\nbecause I released new zines (Bite Size Networking and HTTP: Learn your browser\u2019s\nlanguage) in those months.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how the $30,000 for September breaks down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it\u2019s 85% sales to individuals, 15% <a href=\"https://wizardzines.com/zines-team/\">corporate licenses</a></li>\n<li>it\u2019s approximately:\n<ul>\n<li>$18,000 the new HTTP zine</li>\n<li>$10,000 the various zine packs (the 6 pack and the 3 pack)</li>\n<li>$2,000 other individual zines</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This September was the month with the most sales ever, which is mostly because\nof individual humans who find the zines useful (thank you!!).</p>\n<h3>expenses</h3>\n<p>The main expenses are paying illustrators and an accountant, a mailing list,\nand various books I buy to learn how to do things better. They probably come\nout to about 10% of revenue or so, and then there are taxes after that.</p>\n<h3>giving away free copies has been great</h3>\n<p>With the HTTP zine, like many of my previous zines, I\u2019ve been giving away one\nfree copy for every copy that people buy, so that people can get it even if $12\nis hard for them to afford. (if you can\u2019t afford $12, <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/http-zine/buy-one-give-one\">here\u2019s the\nlink</a>, there are about 70\navailable as I\u2019m writing this). I\u2019m pretty happy with this setup \u2013 we\u2019ve given\naway 1358 copies so far. (I think of this as kind of a \u201csales\u201d statistic too)</p>\n<p>I think I want to automate the system to give away free copies a bit more soon\n(like by automatically updating the number of free zines available using the\nGumroad API instead of periodically doing it manually).</p>\n<h3>hopefully this is a useful data point!</h3>\n<p>Writing about money on the internet is weird, so this will probably be the\nfirst and last zine revenue post, but I\u2019m writing it down in the hopes that\nit\u2019s a useful data point for others. I thought for a long time that you could\nonly really make money from writing on the internet with ads or sponsorships,\nbut it\u2019s not true!</p>\n<p>The goal of this isn\u2019t to say \u201cyou should run a business\u201d or anything, just\nthat this is a thing that\u2019s possible in the world and that many developers\ndo really value good educational materials and are happy to pay for them (if\nyou\u2019re one of those people, thank you!)</p>"

Deep Fusion is a technique that blends multiple exposures\ntogether at the pixel level to give users a higher level of detail\nthan is possible using standard HDR imaging\u2009\u2014\u2009especially in\nimages with very complicated textures like skin, clothing or\nfoliage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It requires the A13 chip, so it\u2019s iPhones 11-only. I spoke with Apple this morning about it, and Panzarino\u2019s description of how Deep Fusion works matches my notes exactly. Just read his write-up.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an interesting tidbit: Deep Fusion only works with the telephoto and regular wide lenses\u2009\u2014\u2009it does <em>not</em> work with the ultra-wide lens. Because of that, Deep Fusion is <em>not</em> compatible with \u201cPhotos Capture Outside the Frame\u201d, because the outside-the-frame content is usually captured with the ultra-wide lens. So I think we now have two reasons why \u201cPhotos Capture Outside the Frame\u201d is not turned on by default:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Apple believes that Deep Fusion will improve more photos for more users than Capture Outside the Frame will, so Capture Outside the Frame is off by default. Deep Fusion is not a mode or even an option like Night Mode is\u2009\u2014\u2009it will simply apply automatically when the Camera app thinks it should. For the wide angle lens, that\u2019s in mid-range indoor lighting conditions; for the telephoto, Deep Fusion will be applied in all but the brightest outdoor conditions. (So, if you want to compare the effect of Deep Fusion, one way to do it is to capture the same scene with and without \u201cPhotos Capture Outside the Frame\u201d enabled\u2009\u2014\u2009only when it\u2019s disabled will Deep Fusion kick in.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Privacy. Someone framing a still photo might have something outside the frame they would not want captured\u2009\u2014\u2009anything from a shirtless portrait where the ultra-wide image would reveal the subject is pantsless as well, to an object on your desk or countertop where the ultra-wide image might reveal an envelope with your home address.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<a title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Deep Fusion Coming to iPhones 11 in iOS 13.2 Beta 1\u2019\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/01/deep-fusion-ios-13-2-beta-1\">\u00a0\u2605\u00a0</a>\n</div>"

You can also buy Anchor in titanium for $29. There are packs, too, including a two-pack of Anchor in titanium for $53.</p>\n<p>Jura has already smashed its goal of raising $30,000, and with nearly 800 backers and growing, it's clear Anchor is an AirPods accessory a lot of people have been waiting for.</p>\n<h3>AirPods accessory</h3>\n<h4>Jura Anchor</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/jura-anchor-ultimate-airpods-accessory\" title=\"Jura Anchor is the ultimate AirPods accessory\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/jura-anchor-airpods-accessory-product.jpg?itok=Y33lksMf\"></a></p>\n<p>Always know where your AirPods are with the new Jura Anchor, which uses a clever proprietary connector to attach a carabiner to your case.

And, as a new component this year, they\u2019re offering teens ages 14-18 free classes all month long. The studio says that, \u201cempowering teens to move with their community will help them feel empowered and will show them the positive impact of a space where everyone belongs.\u201d</p>\n<p>BurnCycle is located at 2420 NW Market St.</p>"

Still, managing documents is a fact of life in many cases, and over the past few years Apple has been evolving the Files app to become a more full-featured file browser utility. In iOS 13, Files takes a huge step forward in numerous areas\u2026 though there\u2019s still more to be done.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most important is the simple fact that Files can now see destinations that aren\u2019t cloud services or other apps. You can add local SMB file servers to Files by tapping the ellipsis icon in the Browse pane and choosing Connect to Server, then entering the address of your SMB server. While you\u2019re connected, that server will appear in the Shared segment of the Browse pane. (Strangely, Files doesn\u2019t use Bonjour to detect nearby servers and display them, as Finder does.) I have a Mac mini on my home network that I use as a file server, and it\u2019s been a delight to access files on it, directly, from within Files and apps that use Apple\u2019s file interface.</p>\n<p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://sixcolors.com/images/content/2019/shortcuts-ios11-ipad-6c.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Browsing a local SMB server in column view, as you do.</figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n<p>USB drives are also supported. It\u2019s kind of hard to believe that I\u2019m celebrating USB disk access in late 2019, but here we are. You can attach USB drives to any device running iOS 13, but this feature certainly feels best when you plug a USB-C cable or thumbdrive directly into an iPad Pro. As an iPad Pro user, that\u2019s a moment that really makes the iPad Pro feel like it\u2019s been welcomed into the community of personal computers. And if you\u2019re someone who has ever been handed a thumbdrive by a colleague who expects you to access it on your iPad, well, now you can do that instead of sheepishly admitting that it\u2019s completely useless to you. I\u2019ve used this feature to attach my portable audio recorder directly to my iPad to import recordings, something I previously <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/12/transferring-sd-card-data-to-ios-fast/\">had to use a breakout box to accomplish</a>.</p>\n<p>You can even create new folders now. Yes. It\u2019s true. And there\u2019s a new Column View, which is an approach to file browsing that I\u2019ve never liked on macOS, but actually makes more sense to me on iOS for some reason.</p>\n<p><figure><img alt=\"shortcuts-ios11-iphone\" src=\"https://sixcolors.com/images/content/2019/shortcuts-ios11-iphone-6c.jpg\">\n<figcaption>Tap and hold to view everything you can do to a given file.</figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n<p>iOS 13 also lets users perform many more actions on files than ever before by tapping and holding on an icon to reveal a contextual menu. Among the actions found here are options to compress files into an archive, decompress zip files, edit tags, preview a file in Quick Look, and display an Info pane with detailed information about a file\u2019s attributes\u2014basically, the stuff you\u2019d expect from a file browser is mostly there. (It\u2019s a bit strange that you can\u2019t set items from Shortcuts to display directly in this contextual menu, as you can in the share sheets elsewhere on iOS 13. Instead, you have to tap and hold on a file, choose Share, and <em>then</em> pick a Shortcuts item.</p>\n<p>Files separates iOS storage into two buckets, On My iPad/iPhone and iCloud Drive. On My iPad is basically what you\u2019d consider \u201cthe hard drive\u201d on a Mac\u2014it\u2019s local storage that is not synced over the cloud. If you want to save a huge file on your iPad and not have it swamp your current connection in an attempt to sync all that data to the cloud, put it in On My iPad/iPhone. If you want it available everywhere, put it in iCloud Drive.</p>\n<p>Alas, not all is sunshine and roses in the land of iOS file access. Files is still a remarkably immature app. It sometimes fails to update file listings, frequently stalls out and provides me with a blank or incomplete listing, and, most frustratingly, the Save to Files extension for third-party apps fails to provide any feedback about the progress of a file transfer. That unreliability, combined with a slow file transfer to a remote server, leads to some pretty uncomfortable moments when you have no idea if your file is going to arrive or if the whole thing has failed silently.</p>\n<p>Apple\u2019s taken a few cues from the Mac in building up Files, so it\u2019s time to take a few more. Progress indicators are vital. Allowing the user to get a detailed view about what\u2019s transferring and how long it will take are must-have features, but when I try to save items within third-party apps, all I get is an endless spinner with no feedback. I realize this isn\u2019t an issue with the Files app itself\u2014it does show a little circular upload/download progress bar\u2014but it is an issue with Apple\u2019s greater approach to file transfers.</p>\n<p>Still, Files has come a long way. It has gone from being an iCloud Drive client app to a neither-fish-nor-fowl representation of Apple\u2019s ambivalence to file management on iOS to what it is today\u2014a pretty capable file browser that\u2019s still got plenty of room for improvement. Files in iOS 13 is a major upgrade\u2014I just hope Apple doesn\u2019t consider the job done.</p>"

Unfortunately, the feature was not available right away with iOS 13, but Apple is starting to roll out the feature with an upcoming developer beta.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893516/apple-deep-fusion-camera-mode-iphone-11-pro-max-ios-13-beta\">The Verge</a>, Deep Fusion will be available for the iPhone 11 models through an upcoming iOS 13 developer beta rolling out today. With the feature upon us, it will give us our first chance to test out the feature besides just looking at the images Apple has shared.</p>\n<p>Deep Fusion uses machine learning to capture more data within an image. Phil Schiller stated it takes three long and short exposure shots before you take an image and then one long exposure shot afterward. It combines all of the images and produces the best image possible.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Apple stated the feature does &quot;pixel-by-pixel processing&quot; to grab the most amount of data from a setting and create an image with the proper detail. The Verge broke down in detail how the process will work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol><li>By the time you press the shutter button, the camera has already grabbed three frames at a fast shutter speed to freeze motion in the shot. When you press the shutter, it take three additional shots, and then one longer exposure to capture detail.</li>\n<li>Those three regular shots and long-exposure shot are merged into what Apple calls a &quot;synthetic long&quot; \u2014 this is a major difference from Smart HDR.</li>\n<li>Deep Fusion picks the short exposure image with the most detail and merges it with the synthetic long exposure \u2014 unlike Smart HDR, Deep Fusion only merges these two frames, not more. These two images are also processed for noise differently than Smart HDR, in a way that's better for Deep Fusion.</li>\n<li>The images are run through four detail processing steps, pixel by pixel, each tailored to increasing amounts of detail \u2014 the sky and walls are in the lowest band, while skin, hair, fabrics, and so on are the highest level. This generates a series of weightings for how to blend the two images \u2014 taking detail from one and tone, tone, and luminance from the other.</li>\n<li>The final image is generated.</li>\n</ol></blockquote>\n<p>Here's an image sample of Deep Fusion in action Apple shared with The Verge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apples-deep-fusion-camera-feature-now-available-ios-13-developer-beta\" title=\"Apple's Deep Fusion camera feature will be available soon with upcoming iOS 13.2 developer beta update\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/10/iphone-11-deep-fusion.jpg?itok=puMFPYhf\"></a> Image: Apple</p>\n<p>Nilay Patel notes that unlike Night Mode, Deep Fusion will not alert users when it is turned on and that it will not work with the ultra wide lens, only the wide and telephoto cameras.</p>\n<p>We look forward to testing out the feature and see how it stacks up. Judging from the technology that goes into it and the images Apple has released, it looks very impressive.</p>\n<p>Apple has been on a rampant upgrade cycle with iOS 13\u2014<a href=\"https://www.imore.com/ios-13-faq\">iOS 13.1.2</a> is now available for all iPhone users\u2014so it seems more upgrades appear to be coming constantly.

Bloomberg reporters Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley were sold a bill of goods by government sources looking to make China look bad and ran with it, and Bloomberg, as a publication, has closed its eyes and stuck its collective fingers in its ears for the last year, refusing to do what they obviously need to do and fully retract the story.</p>\n<p>And now they\u2019ve promoted Riley to \u201ccybersecurity czar\u201d for the entire outlet.

While evaluating it, I considered comfort, volume, price, sound quality, and convenience. The thing that makes this wireless controller stand out is that it's readily available to use with just about any gaming device you own, whether it be PC, Android phone, or console. Unlike other wireless headsets, this one comes with its own dongle transmitter, so it easily works with the Nintendo Switch right out of the box.</p>\n<p>In addition to the wireless transmitter, it comes with a USB-A adapter cable, a 3.5 mm audio cable, and a removable microphone. I tested it on my Nintendo Switch, PS4, Android smartphone, and my PC. It worked beautifully on each of these devices. It's definitely got its flaws, but overall this is a great headset for any gamer, especially if you play on multiple devices. Just note that it only works with a smartphone that features a USB-C port.</p>\n<h2>SteelSeries Acrtis 1 Wireless Headset</h2>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Gaming Headset review: Wireless perfection for your Nintendo Switch and beyond\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset.jpg?itok=YCwNK_tj\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-PlayStation/dp/B07X96DFR5?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57401YYr\" title=\"\">$100 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>This headset provides great sound quality and comes with all of the cables and adapters necessary to play on any PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC, or Android Phone.

What I love about the Arctis 1 Wireless Headset is that it comes with everything you need to use the headset wirelessly on the Nintendo Switch, whether you're playing in handheld mode or docked mode.</p>\n<p>To play in handheld mode, you simply insert the USB-C transmitter into the bottom of your Switch. If you're wanting to play in docked mode, you connect the USB-A adapter to your Dock and then plug the USB-C transmitter into the other end of the cable. When I tested, the headphones worked right away in both scenarios.</p>\n<h4>A great gaming headset</h4>\n<h2>SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Headset: <em>What I like</em></h2>\n<div><div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-0019.jpg?itok=ppCoJpCS\"></div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-0018.jpg?itok=5_fKCj3Z\"></div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-001.jpg?itok=4xxL-5yH\"></div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-0020.jpg?itok=QPS_Qr6j\"></div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-0010.jpg?itok=D-I-y4uu\"></div></div> </div>\n<p>I really like the sound quality on these headphones. The audio comes through clear and the volume controls have a decent range. I was able to get about 20 hours of battery life out of this headset before it needed a recharge. It's not as long as some other headphones, but it's definitely long enough to last you through a few gaming sessions. It comes with a USB-A to micro USB adapter to easily charge the device when the battery gets low.</p>\n<p>I love having a detachable microphone cause, let's face it, most Nintendo Switch games don't have a need for one. However, if I want to jump onto Fortnite, I can easily attach the microphone and talk to my buddies. When communicating with others online, my voice comes through clear and loud without issue. It's definitely not the best microphone in the world, but it shouldn't give you any significant problems.</p>\n<p>I wore these headphones for several hours at a time and I never experienced any head fatigue or pressure like I do with some other headsets. They adjust comfortably and have a decent amount of cushion. I also love how easy it is to adjust the volume or mute buttons while I'm wearing them. I can seamlessly make an adjustment without taking time away from my game.</p>\n<div><div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-030.jpg?itok=MwPjjVpO\"></div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-031.jpg?itok=i6LCZ8yg\"></div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-029.jpg?itok=1DYy2b9r\"></div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-028.jpg?itok=h4MEE4Qu\"></div></div> </div>\n<p>While I spent most of my time testing it on the Nintendo Switch, I also briefly used the headset with my PS4, PC, laptop, and Android Phone. It worked equally well in each scenario. But something to note is that you must plug the USB-C transmitter into each of these devices in order for it to work.</p>\n<p>You can do this by sticking the dongle directly into a USB-C port or by plugging the USB-A adapter into your PC or PS4 and then plugging the transmitter into the other side of the cable. It's a little strange rather than simply using a Bluetooth connection directly on these devices, but it makes it so you can use the same wireless headset with all of your gaming platforms. I know that's something Nintendo Switch fans will especially appreciate.</p>\n<h4>No convenient carry bag</h4>\n<h2>SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Headset : <em>What I don't like</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Gaming Headset review: Wireless perfection for your Nintendo Switch and beyond\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-032.jpg?itok=-JeFXica\"></a></p>\n<p>The first con is a big one - the Arctis 1 Wireless Headset doesn't work wirelessly with the Xbox One. It does work with a wireless connection, however, and comes with a 3.5 mm cable for you to plug into your Xbox controller. The lack of wireless functionality with the Xbox One is a big downside if that's one of your main consoles. If you don't have an Xbox One, then this obviously won't be a problem for you.</p>\n<p>My other gripe isn't huge, but I think it's valid - this headset doesn't come with a carrying case or bag of any kind. Considering that it comes with the dongle, several cables, and was marketed as being a wireless headset for the Nintendo Switch, I would have expected the SteelSeries to make it easier for gamers to bring everything on the go. After all, it's not always the easiest thing to bring your Nintendo Switch accessories along with you on your regular commute or on a trip.</p>\n<p>At least there are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-System-Backpack-Elite-500-118/dp/B07GX6PBF2?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57401YYr\" title=\"\">Switch traveling bags</a> out there that are large enough to fit your headphones, Switch console, the transmitter adapter, and any necessary cables you might want. Other than those two things, this is a great wireless headset that can work with just about any gamer.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div data-clone-id=\"\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>A headset for Switch gamers</h4>\n<h2>SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Headset <em>Bottom line</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Gaming Headset review: Wireless perfection for your Nintendo Switch and beyond\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-0012.jpg?itok=Xe0VIScs\"></a></p>\n<p> </p><div>\n<span>4.5</span>\n<span>out of 5</span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </div>\n<p>The SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Gaming Headset is a great option for any Nintendo Switch gamer. In addition to providing excellent sound quality, it comes with the necessary cable and dongle transmitter to play your Nintendo Switch both in handheld mode and in docked mode. If you want to use the headset wirelessly on your PC, Android Phone that features a USB-C port, or PS4 you can. Strangely, it only works via wired connection with the Xbox One, but it does work.</p>\n<p>It would have been better if the headset came with a carrying case of some kind so you could carry all of the included cables and the dongle along with the headset, but that's not the worst thing in the world. All in all, it's a great choice for any Nintendo Switch gamers who also play games on other devices.</p>\n<h2>SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Headset</h2>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span></span>\n</span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless Gaming Headset review: Wireless perfection for your Nintendo Switch and beyond\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset.jpg?itok=YCwNK_tj\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-PlayStation/dp/B07X96DFR5?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57401YYr\" title=\"\">$100 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>This headset provides great sound quality and comes with all of the cables and adapters necessary to play on any PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC, or Android Phone.

While evaluating it, I considered comfort, volume, price, sound quality, and convenience. The thing that makes this wireless controller stand out is that it's readily available to use with just about any gaming device you own, whether it be PC, Android phone, or console. Unlike other wireless headsets, this one comes with its own dongle transmitter, so it easily works with the Nintendo Switch right out of the box.\nIn addition to the wireless transmitter, it comes with a USB-A adapter cable, a 3.5 mm audio cable, and a removable microphone. I tested it on my Nintendo Switch, PS4, Android smartphone, and my PC. It worked beautifully on each of these devices.

They're durable, lightweight, and flexible, making them incredibly versatile for all of your mobile photography needs. The GorillaPod Hybrid is made with strong and durable Japanese medical-grade ABS plastic and German TPE for secure joints. This tripod will work just as well on the 1000th day of use as it was when you first get it. These things are built to last, and there's a fantastic year-long warranty if something should go wrong.</p>\n<p>With the GorillaPod Hybrid, it's easy to take it with you anywhere, whether it's travel or just when you're out-and-about looking for something to photograph. This new Hybrid version includes a clamp to fit your smartphone, such as the iPhone 11 series. Plus, it connects to the tripod via two 1/4&quot; female threads, which allow you to position your smartphone in multiple positions.</p>\n<p>As you use the GorillaPod Hybrid, you can adjust the flexible legs however you want for composition. Then, you can fine-tune it with the ball heads on the joints to get the perfect shot. The Hybrid has a bubble spirit level that helps keep your iPhone lined up properly, and a quick-release plate so that you can pack everything up quickly. It also has a 180\u00b0 tilt and 360\u00b0 panning view. To top it all off, this version has a Selfie Bluetooth Remote Control that works up to 30 feet away. This works for both still photos and videos so that you can get that perfect Slofie.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>Lightweight, flexible, and very durable</li>\n<li>Works with regular cameras and smartphones</li>\n<li>Bubble spirit level keeps phone lined up with 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 panning views</li>\n<li>Quick-release plate means easy packing</li>\n<li>Includes Bluetooth remote control</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>A little pricey</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Overall</h2>\n<h3 rel=\"nofollow\">Joby GorillaPod Hybrid</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-tripods-photographing-night-mode-iphone-11\" title=\"Best Tripods for Photographing in Night Mode on iPhone 11 in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/joby-gorillapod-hybrid-product.jpg?itok=pH_CG9-O\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Joby-GorillaPod-Compact-Smartphone-Bluetooth/dp/B07JG4245L/?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57731YYr\">$40 at Amazon</a></li>\n</ul><p>Flexibility and stability</p>\n<p>Joby GorillaPods are known for their sturdiness and flexibility.

Our favorite part about them is the flexible legs that can wrap around any object or surface, giving you the best possible angles and views.</p>\n<p>The GorillaPod Hybrid is also super compact and lightweight, so traveling around with it is a breeze. The spirit bubble level is nice to give you straight shots, and the quick release plate means it's easy to set up and then pack up when you need to run. The tilting and multiple angles that you can get with the GorillaPod are also top-notch.</p>\n<h2>Credits \u2014 The team that worked on this guide</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://passport.mobilenations.com/avatars/000/010/458/100x100_10458455.jpg?r=3\"></p>\n<p><strong>Christine Romero-Chan</strong> is an avid iPhone photographer who is always out there shooting photos (mostly at Disneyland these days) with her trusty iPhones.

Here are the eight best solutions for keeping your Mac safe while also protecting your Windows-using family, friends, and co-workers. My top pick is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbitdefender.evyy.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F278689%2F4466%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU57027YYr%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bitdefender.com%252Fsolutions%252Fantivirus-for-mac.html&token=P2rYwMKe\" title=\"\">Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</a>. It quickly and securely stopped 99% of threats without creating drag, plus it comes with some extra security tools and multiple user licenses.</p>\n<h2>Best Overall: <em>Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</em></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/bitdefender-antivirus-mac-01.jpg?itok=1pHt2kHB\"></a></p>\n<p>Bitdefender is the best because it does a great job stopping malware before it has a chance even to start downloading. Plus, most threats are instantly scrubbed without ever hitting the quarantine folder. This is because Bitdefender taps into several malware databases to keep tabs on what's out there and block it quickly. It also recognized traits in new threats, known as zero-day malware, that haven't been identified yet and stops them. Bitdefender also recognized and stopped more Windows threats than other Mac antivirus programs. This ensures you don't accidentally send a threat to family or friends using a PC.</p>\n<p>On top of great protection, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac includes a vulnerability scanner and a VPN. It also both blocks and removes adware, which reduces how often you'll see targeted ads. There are a few missing tools, though. Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac doesn't come with either a personal firewall or a password manager. It also doesn't include extra security for banking and shopping online. But overall Bitdefender is a very secure and reliable program that works without causing noticeable drag or slowdown of your computer. Plus, it comes with multiple user licenses to protect more than one device for about the same cost as other solutions that only give you a single license.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>99% protection score</li>\n<li>VPN</li>\n<li>Blocks malware</li>\n<li>Vulnerability scanner</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>No firewall</li>\n<li>No password manager</li>\n<li>Tricky to use</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Overall</h2>\n<h3 rel=\"nofollow\">Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/bitdefender-antivirus-for-mac-boxshot.jpg?itok=TSGujTA3\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbitdefender.evyy.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F278689%2F4466%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU57027YYr%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bitdefender.com%252Fsolutions%252Fantivirus-for-mac.html&token=P2rYwMKe\">$60 from Bitdefender</a></li>\n</ul><p>Lots of protection without the drag</p>\n<p>This antivirus software stops Mac malware without slowing down your computer.

And since it has secure delete, threats are permanently scrubbed from computers, so there isn't any chance of being infected from remnants left behind. I was impressed with how quickly my Macs continued to run even during deep virus scans. I easily sent emails, attached files, downloaded programs, navigated the web, and even watched videos online with noticing any drag or buffering. Kaspersky also did an excellent job stopping Windows malware, reducing the risk of accidentally sending these on to PC users.</p>\n<p>For the price, Kaspersky includes an impressive amount of security features most other basic Mac antivirus programs don't include. You get a password manager that keeps your login credentials shielded while you access online accounts. Plus, it has additional shields and protections especially designed for banking and shopping transactions, including an in-browser, virtual keyboard that's harder for keyloggers to trace.</p>\n<p>But the most prominent security tool included with Kaspersky is webcam monitoring. This keeps an eye out for any program or person trying to access your webcam without your permission. The only feature that I would have liked to have seen in Kaspersky's Mac program is a vulnerability scanner to help strengthen weak points where ransomware and hackers can sneak in.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>Password manager</li>\n<li>Webcam blocking</li>\n<li>Safe banking tools</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>No vulnerability scans</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Value</h2>\n<h3>Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/kaspersky-internet-security-mac-boxshot.jpg?itok=u5W_sRPm\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://usa.kaspersky.com/mac-security\">$40 from Kaspersky</a></li>\n</ul><p>More security for less money</p>\n<p>This program stops malware from infecting your computer but also monitors your webcam from being accessed without your permission.

This program stopped 100% of Mac threats and 95% of Windows threats during testing. I was really impressed with how well AVG recognized the zipped test file as containing malware during the decompression process. It quarantined the entire folder instead of waiting for each file to download. Even when I allowed some threat to download completely, AVG was able to find them quickly. While it doesn't have a lot of extras, this free Mac antivirus impressed me with including a vulnerability scanner. This tool looks for outdated programs and drivers - where ransomware tends to sneak in - and gives suggestions on where to download a legitimate patch or updated version.</p>\n<p>This free antivirus program is super easy to install and use. Each function is represented by a large icon that glows red when it isn't set up and green when it's ready to use. However, because AVG is a free program, I experienced a lot of pop-up ads. While this is very common among free software programs, it does become frustrating having to close these at the most inopportune times. There are moments when these ads become bothersome, like interrupting while watching videos, or while downloading programs and sometimes during online chats. But overall AVG Antivirus for Mac is a great program for stopping malware.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>Free program</li>\n<li>Excellent malware protection</li>\n<li>Easy to use</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>In-program pop-up ads</li>\n<li>No password protection</li>\n<li>No firewall</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Free Antivirus</h2>\n<h3 rel=\"nofollow\">AVG Antivirus for Mac</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/avg-antivirus-boxshot.jpg?itok=SBJzZ7LK\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293438-10639600%3Fsid%3DUUimUdUnU57027YYr%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.avg.com%252Fen-us%252Fall-products%253Fr%253D1%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.avg.com%252Fen-us%252Fall-products%253Fr%253D1%2523platform%253Dmac%2526customer%253Dhome&token=2s-ELjjX\">Free from AVG</a></li>\n</ul><p>Top security without paying a penny</p>\n<p>AVG offers excellent malware protection and includes a vulnerability scanner.

In my tests of Mac antivirus, Avast stopped all threats in record time. This program is easy to install and figure out how to use it. Tools and functions are clearly marked or easy to find from the user dashboard. Plus, Avast Premium Security includes a personal firewall for monitoring anything trying to sneak in through your internet connection. Its Webshield keeps you from accessing fake sites, which is essential when you're shopping or banking online. It ensures you land on a legitimate page instead of one designed to look correct, but is really a phishing scheme to collect personal information and steal your identity.</p>\n<p>There are a few other tools available for Avast Premium Security users, like the VPN, password manager, anti-tracking tools, and system cleaner. However, these are programs that need to be downloaded, set up, and used separately from the antivirus program. Each of these tools is very useful, and I recommend using them. However, it does make it more difficult toggling between programs compared to those Mac antivirus solutions. Those can be easily accessed from the user dashboard.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>Perfect malware protection score</li>\n<li>Fake website detection</li>\n<li>Personal firewall</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>Download some tools separately</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Premium Protection</h2>\n<h3 rel=\"nofollow\">Avast Premium Security</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/avast-premium-security-boxshot.jpg?itok=uoezI2Ud\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293438-12258350%3Fsid%3DUUimUdUnU57027YYr%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.avast.com%252Fen-us%252Fpremium-security&token=RuMnWT_u\">$80 from Avast</a></li>\n</ul><p>Premium tools for premium protection</p>\n<p>Avast blocks fake sites, stops malicious files from downloading and filters threats and phishing schemes from email messages.

It includes VirusBarrier, NetBarrier, ContentBarrier, WashingMachine, and Personal Backup. The VirusBarrier program is the primary antivirus software. It recognized 98% of the malware threats in my tests. Intego's other programs include a personal firewall and great parental controls that both manage time and block inappropriate content. Intego's WashingMachine looks for junk files, outdated software programs, and files you haven't accessed in a while and helps you dispose or update them to help your Mac run faster.</p>\n<p>Intego takes a long time to download and install, and when the program is fully up and running, it does create a noticeable slowdown to your computer. Because each tool is a separate program, you do have to open and toggle between them rather than having access to them from a single dashboard. Also, Intego Mac Premium Bundle doesn't recognize Windows malware at all. You'll need to be extra vigilant when sending attachments and links to PC users to ensure you're not passing a threat on to them.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>Mac exclusive</li>\n<li>Firewall</li>\n<li>Vulnerability scanner</li>\n<li>Parental controls</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>Causes drag</li>\n<li>Not easy to use</li>\n<li>Doesn't stop Windows threats</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Mac Exclusive</h2>\n<h3 rel=\"nofollow\">Intego Mac Premium Bundle X9</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/intego-mac-premium-bundle-boxshot.jpg?itok=EHHfJgHr\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293438-12258350%3Fsid%3DUUimUdUnU57027YYr%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.avast.com%252Fpremium-security&token=TTYBb_-5\">$85 from Intego</a></li>\n</ul><p>Antivirus exclusively made for Mac machines</p>\n<p>Intego bundles all its top security programs together for ultimate Mac protection.

Plus, it used a lot of system resources which created lag on computers. But it has worked hard over the last few years and now is an industry leader and my top pick for the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-antivirus-software\">best Windows antivirus</a>. While testing McAfee Total Protection on Mac, I was impressed with how fast it stopped malicious downloads, blocked dangerous websites, and warned of phishing schemes. It earned a perfect score for stopping all threats. McAfee Total Protection is an excellent choice for families that have multiple devices to protect. It works on PCs, and both Android and iPhones with all devices and settings managed from a single online account. Plus, McAfee has some of the best parental controls that both block inappropriate content and control when and how long children can be online.</p>\n<p>Because McAfee Total Protection is a premium security program, it includes an impressive number of extra tools, including a personal firewall and safe banking tools. McAfee is unique because it monitors cryptocurrency accounts to ensure ransomware and other threats don't hack into them and illegally mine your money. However, it is missing both a vulnerability scanner and a VPN. While a VPN isn't typically included with antivirus software, vulnerability scanners are. So, it is a little disappointing this important tool isn't included with McAfee Total Protection.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>Compatible with multiple devices</li>\n<li>Parental controls</li>\n<li>Fast, accurate protection</li>\n<li>Cryptocurrency protection</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>No vulnerability scans</li>\n<li>VPN not included</li>\n</ul><h2>Best for Families</h2>\n<h3 rel=\"nofollow\">McAfee Total Protection</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/mcafee-total-protection-boxshot.jpg?itok=yeYpjgbz\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmcafee-na-streamline.7eer.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F280603%2F4474%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU57027YYr%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.mcafee.com%252Fconsumer%252Fen-us%252Fstore%252Fm0%252Fmcafee-total-protection-lp.html&token=EB9sjAbG\">$110 from McAfee</a></li>\n</ul><p>Protection for all your family's devices</p>\n<p>McAfee works on all your family's devices and includes parental controls for a good family solution to cybersecurity.

Norton stopped 100% of Mac threats without a problem, though it did struggle a bit recognizing Windows threats downloaded to Mac computers. This isn't a problem for your computer, but these threats can be sent on to Windows users who will become infected. Also, during my testing, I didn't experience the same slowdown on my Mac test computer as I did on my Windows PCs, and other third-party test labs, like AV-Test, show the same results. However, this changed a bit when I installed Norton on my home computers where more software is installed and used. Here there was a noticeable lag that at the time became problematic. Overall, Norton 360 Standard protects well and performs decently, especially if you don't have a lot stored locally on your computer.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>High protection score</li>\n<li>Dark web monitoring</li>\n<li>Firewall</li>\n<li>VPN</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>Some slowdown</li>\n<li>Doesn't stop all Windows threats</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Identity Protection</h2>\n<h3 rel=\"nofollow\">Norton 360 Standard</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/norton-360-standards-boxshot.jpg?itok=K1AHEv5R\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Ftrack.flexlinkspro.com%2Fa.ashx%3Ffoid%3D1081664.140954961%26foc%3D1%26fot%3D9999%26fos%3D1%26fobs%3DUUimUdUnU57027YYr%26fobs2%3Ddim%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fus.norton.com%252Fproducts%252Fnorton-360-standard&token=iJyFc9HA\">$80 from Symantec</a></li>\n</ul><p>Dark web monitoring protects your identity</p>\n<p>Norton helps protect your identity with dark web monitoring and unlimited VPN access.

This monitors your accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and other social platforms. It warns you when something shared or displayed will lead to a dangerous website, phishing scheme, or download a threat. During my testing of the best Mac antivirus programs, Trend Micro stopped every threat from downloading. Some of these were instantly scrubbed, but most of them were sent to the quarantine folder.</p>\n<p>The most frustrating part of using this program was figuring out how to delete malware sitting in quarantine permanently. After some trial and error, and a Google search, I learned there is a padlock icon at the bottom of the viewing screen. Clicking this unlocks the folder so you can then select and permanently delete infected files.</p>\n<p>Trend Micro includes an impressive list of security features with its Mac solution. These include a password manager, a vulnerability scanner, and some of the best parental controls. One tool missing is a firewall. Trend Micro also doesn't have a VPN or banking tools that other programs include. This program does use a lot of system resources. You will notice some slowdown, and both vulnerability and virus scans take much longer than most other Mac antivirus.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul><li>Social network protection</li>\n<li>Vulnerability scans</li>\n<li>Password manager</li>\n<li>Parental controls</li>\n</ul><h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul><li>No firewall</li>\n<li>Long scans</li>\n<li>Creates drag</li>\n</ul><h2>Best Social Protection</h2>\n<h3 rel=\"nofollow\">Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/trend-micro-antivirus-mac-boxshot.jpg?itok=ExIQVSZx\"></a></p>\n<ul rel=\"nofollow\"><li><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293438-10750933%3Fsid%3DUUimUdUnU57027YYr%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.trendmicro.com%252Fen_us%252FforHome%252Fproducts%252Fantivirus-for-mac.html&token=jOSfoTYJ\">$40 from Trend Micro</a></li>\n</ul><p>Keeps tabs on social media</p>\n<p>This program monitors social media accounts for malicious links that are posted to look innocent.

It stops 99% of Mac malware threats and a decent amount of Windows threats, so you don't accidentally pass on malware to PC using family and friends. Bitdefender has a VPN and adware removal to give you a better, private, and more secure online experience. Plus, does it without using too much of your computer's resources. This basic antivirus program includes a few upgraded tools, like a vulnerability scanner, and comes with three user licenses to protect multiple Mac computers at once. I'm especially impressed with how Bitdefender stops threats before the download process even starts rather than waiting for the infect folder to start downloading, fully open, or deploy before permanently deleting the threat.</p>\n<h2>How I tested Mac antivirus</h2>\n<p>The most significant risk in testing antivirus programs is ensuring other devices on your network don't become infected with the live malware samples used for testing. For this to work, I tested Mac antivirus programs on computers connected to a designated network. During testing, only the test computer was connected to the internet with all other devices, including mobile devices, safely disconnected. Test computers were factory set with only default programs installed, and reset to these settings after testing each antivirus program. After installing each antivirus software, all security features were disabled both on the Mac computer and within each of the web browsers used for testing.</p>\n<p>A large, compressed file of several hundred Mac malware files was downloaded and opened. It was easy to see as antivirus programs either stopped the download process or captured the threat as each malicious file opened. Threats were generally sent directly to the antivirus program's quarantine folder. After the initial download, I then used the installed antivirus program's virus scanner. Sometimes this found some of the threats that weren't stopped during the download process. These, too, were sent to the quarantine folder. While some credit is due when a program can successfully find a threat that has infected a Mac, it is more critical that infections don't happen in the first place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/av-mac-testing-1.jpg?itok=5zMXlEyu\"></a></p>\n<p>After testing with Mac malware, I duplicated these tests using Windows malware. While Windows threats won't affect your Mac, they can accidentally be forwarded on, usually through an infected IM or email file, to Windows users, who then become infected. I also checked out each program's browser extensions, again with browser security settings disabled, to see how well each antivirus Mac program recognized and blocked dangerous websites, especially phishing schemes.</p>\n<p>My final test was installing these programs on my home computers, and on lab computers with a lot of programs on them. I didn't attempt to download malware in these cases. Instead, I looked at how well each antivirus program performed in a natural setting. I wanted to see if any slowdown or lag occurred while the security program was installed, during updates and while performing virus scans. The most frustrating element of any antivirus program is slowing down your computer and interfere with your work.</p>\n<h2>Credits \u2014 The team that worked on this guide</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/best-antivirus-software-mac\" title=\"Best Antivirus Software for Mac in 2019\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/05/nicole_johnston_mobile_nations.jpg?itok=7e0pWt0n\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Nicole Johnston</strong> writes for multiple Mobile Nation brands, including iMore, covering internet security and privacy programs.

Any fish that see you will <strong>try to stop you.</strong></li>\n<li>You may need to <strong>fish up a catch or two</strong> before doing this to get particularly pesky fish out of the way.</li>\n<li>If you fail, the bottle <strong>drops where it falls</strong> and you can always try again.</li>\n</ol><h3>Getting Fairy Bottle 2</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-find-all-fairy-bottles-links-awakening\" title=\"How to find all fairy bottles in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/links-awakening-nintendo-switch-fairy-03.jpg?itok=GYZdQV6k\"></a></p>\n<ol><li>You'll get the second bottle automatically as part of the main story <strong>after the fourth dungeon.</strong></li>\n<li>A <strong>pink ghost</strong> will start following you around, mentioning a house.</li>\n<li>Take her to the <strong>abandoned house</strong> in the easternmost area of <strong>Martha's Bay.</strong> It's just to the right of Toronbo Shores.</li>\n<li>After a quick scene, take the ghost to its grave <strong>near the Witch's House.</strong></li>\n<li>The grave isn't in the cemetery proper.

If you've ever seen a fairy floating around at either a Great Fairy Fountain or elsewhere in the world, you can equip a bottle to one of your action buttons (X or Y) and &quot;use&quot; it to capture the fairy.</p>\n<p>Using the bottle again will free the fairy, restoring a significant number of hearts. It's great to keep these full and on you at all times, as it essentially gives you extra lives in dangerous places where you might be taking a lot of hits. Be warned: in other Zelda games, dying will automatically release a fairy on your person to revive you. That doesn't happen in Link's Awakening! You have to release them manually.</p>\n<h2>Our top equipment picks</h2>\n<p>Everything you need to set out on your adventure on Koholint Island:</p>\n<h3>The adventure itself</h3>\n<h4>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-find-all-fairy-bottles-links-awakening\" title=\"How to find all fairy bottles in Link's Awakening\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/links-awakening-screenshot-attack.jpg?itok=44tzWyVp\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Links-Awakening-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07SG15148?th=1&tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU57747YYr\" title=\"\">$60 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>Awake the wind fish</p>\n<p>Link finds himself stranded on a strange island that exists in the shadow of a massive egg.

Others\u2026 press releases just dropped at the dawn.</p>\n<p>This year\u2026 this year\u2026 it feels like Tim Cook and company might just put sneaker to keynote stage one more time. But\u2026 announce what exactly?</p>\n<div><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0Ke8hmmDNs?modestbranding=0&html5=1&rel=0&autoplay=0&wmode=opaque&loop=0&controls=1&autohide=0&showinfo=0&theme=dark&color=red&enablejsapi=1\" width=\"627\" height=\"400\"></iframe></div></div>\n\n<h2>When and where?</h2>\n<p>Unlike the iPhone Event, which always lands on the second Tuesday, sometimes Wednesday, of September, the iPad and Mac Event has just been scattered around the second half of October. October 23rd, October 13th, October 16th, October 27th, October 30th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/october-2019-apple-event-preview\" title=\"October 2019 Apple Event Preview: iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and more\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2018/10/apple-october-event-venue.jpg?itok=lYVz8XEK\"></a></p>\n<p>The location has also moved around more. Where the September events have all been in and around the Bay Area, the October event has moved from its root in Town Hall at Infinite Loop to, last year, the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York.</p>\n<p>This year? Well\u2026 we'll just have to wait and see.</p>\n<p>There is one thing I can guess at with a high degree of certainty, though \u2014 video montage or no, when the lights come on and Tim Cook walks out, he'll say\u2026</p>\n<p>GOOD MORNING</p>\n<h2>Apple tags</h2>\n<p>The September event came and went, and with nary a mention of one of the biggest rumors of the year, and something I'd been particularly interested in seeing made manifest: Apple Tags.</p>\n<p>We did get the new U1 spatial positioning chip in the new iPhones 11, though right now relegated to singling someone out for priority AirDrop. But we didn't get the little U1 disks to go with them. You know, the ones with tiny Apple logos that we could put on or in anything and use Apple's new Find My service to precisely track down.</p>\n<p>If the tags simply weren't ready for September, and Apple didn't want to risk another over promise and under-deliver AirPower moment, well, maybe they're ready now?</p>\n<p>Tim could do the honors himself but, since we didn't get to see senior Vice President of software engineering, Craig Federighi, back in September, and the bits here are going to be so much more interesting than the atoms, maybe he could do the honors?</p>\n<p>If so, run and done, and back to Tim.</p>\n<h2>iPads Pro</h2>\n<p>Last year Apple started with the Mac. And they needed to. The MacBook Air hadn't seen a major update since Steve Jobs re-announced it almost a decade prior and the Mac mini had been stuck in a rut for years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/october-2019-apple-event-preview\" title=\"October 2019 Apple Event Preview: iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and more\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2018/11/ipad-pro-2018-macbook-air.jpg?itok=rUjiHpeS\"></a></p>\n<p>This year there's arguably a Mac that needs an update even more today, but I think it might just be a headliner worth holding off on until the end.</p>\n<p>So, maybe this year the iPad Pro takes the lead? Tim could give us a recap of last year's big redesign, show us a video of what we're all doing with it, and then hand off once again to Vice President of hardware, John Ternus for the next iteration. After all, Joz already had his fun with the new 10.2-inch iPad last month, and Phil might be saved for that aforementioned headliner.</p>\n<p>Now, some people might be wondering, even out loud, what Apple could possibly do to get those of us who bought the new iPad Pro last year to upgrade again this year. The answer is\u2026 that's the wrong question. Apple doesn't think that way. Outside of tech pundits, no one does. There are people who upgrade every year, sure. Personally and professionally. But they're basically a done deal. Apple has them at new. For everyone else, the vast majority of everyone else, Apple just wants to make int so that, whether you're buying for the first time in a few years or the first time ever, you have something good to buy. The best current product you can get.</p>\n<p>What does that mean for this year? Well, rumor has it, a very iPhone Pro-like camera system with telephoto, wide angle, and ultra wide angle. And it wouldn't just be the first three-camera system. It would be the first multi-camera system and, if memory serves, the first time the iPad camera is treated with anything approaching iPhone parity. Given how good that camera is and how big the iPad Pro viewfinder is, that might just be a match made in cinematic 4K heaven.</p>\n<p>An A13 or A13X processor is the closest thing we have to a sure thing, which should propel iPad performance even further ahead of what anyone else is doing at anything approaching mobile.</p>\n<p>As to the rest of the usual nerd wish-list\u2026 Apple hasn't gone OLED on the iPad yet because of supply limitations, price points, and the problem getting uniform brightness on a panel that big. If any of that has been solved for, we could see it. But, recent Kuo Ming-Chi rumors suggest Apple is holding off for miniLED next year or the year after. Get your Beyond Retina XDR snarks ready!</p>\n<p>We got USB-C last year, but Thunderbolt 3 would still require PCIe architecture, something which I think is still limited to just the internal storage controller right now.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'd love it if the TrueDepth camera would move from portrait to landscape position, and for the Smart Keyboard to get a Smart Trackpad so the universal input circle would be complete.</p>\n<p>But, as we know, I don't every time get what I want.</p>\n<p>Maybe we'll get an update on Adobe Photoshop for iPad, if that's making progress, and we'll no doubt get a video.</p>\n<p>Then back to Tim.</p>\n<h2>The Macs</h2>\n<p>Apple's been really aggressive with MacBook Pro updates lately. Even after we got Coffee Lake last year, we got Vega Pro in the fall, then Coffee Lake refresh again this spring. So did the iMacs. Non Pro, of course.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/october-2019-apple-event-preview\" title=\"October 2019 Apple Event Preview: iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and more\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/07/macbook-air-2018-front-hero.jpeg?itok=J_MyRP7D\"></a></p>\n<p>The other MacBooks, not so much. Sure, the Air is running Amber Lake, which cries every time it sees an Apple AX-Series\u2026 at least for now. But maybe Intel could do something to put just a little more punch in its performance\u2026 you know, before Apple announces the first MacBook on ARM at some point in what feels like the increasingly fast approaching future. Any event now. Seriously. Please.</p>\n<p>The Mac mini, though, which absolutely languished until last year's October Event could use an overt sign of Apple's continued love. So, it'd be great to see Tim hand off to head of Mac Product Marketing, Tom Boger for that or Colleen Novielli, head oof iMac Product Marketing, for something similar on the iMac Pro side. Since those Xeon's are still the same as they were when Apple announced it back during WWDC 2017.</p>\n<p>Roll it into a single &quot;We're also updating some of our favorite Macs&quot; slide or two if they have to, just keep that stuff regular.</p>\n<p>And, yeah, a redesigned iMac would be terrific as well. It's been a 5K minute since the last one. But Apple sells far more portables than desktops, so I'm thinking they'll let those take the lead on leaps. Even though, now that there's a new Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR coming this year, that iMac Pro is going to have to stay on its toes\u2026 and maybe even up its own display game.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, some final details on the Mac Pro, including how much those damn wheels cost\u2026 thanks Joz\u2026 would make the kind of sense that does. And so would exact availability.</p>\n<p>Then, back to Tim.</p>\n<h2>New MacBook Pro</h2>\n<p>Is it One More Thing worthy? I don't know. But I know that I want it. The butterfly keyboards have been the most divisive thing to happen to the MacBook line in general, and the Pros in particular since\u2026 well, ever. And the failure rates have been one of their biggest failures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/october-2019-apple-event-preview\" title=\"October 2019 Apple Event Preview: iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and more\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/field/image/2019/05/macbook-pro-2019-fake-mockup.jpg?itok=VFqlPilR\"></a></p>\n<p>Fake Mockup of what a new MacBook Pro could look like.</p>\n<p>So, what I want to see, is that new scissor switch keyboard. Rumor has it Apple's been working on it for a while, and hopefully give the Pro Workflows team full time and furious feedback on it to make sure it really stands up to pro usage. That alone would be a huge upgrade\u2026 regrade\u2026 fixgrade\u2026? But rumor also has it Apple is going to continue their war on bezels by taking the 15-inch display all the way to 16-inches, and in roughly the same package size.</p>\n<p>There could be other stuff thrown in as well. I for one would capitol L love Face ID on the Mac. But just fixing the keyboard and escalating the display would make it the upgrade pretty much everyone has been waiting for.</p>\n<p>And if the Air gets the new keyboard too, so much the better.</p>\n<h2>Any more things\u2026?</h2>\n<p>Apple TV+ is still coming up, so there's always the chance we'll hear more about that, and possibly more about the expansion of Apple's other services. An updated Apple TV with an A12X that could slay composited 4K HDR would be awesome. So would an Apple TV stick we could take with us. HomePod, HomePod mini, HomePod Theater, and all that would also be grand. But, I'm only going to expect all that when I see it.</p>\n<p>Last year we had Angela Ahrendts up, in between Mac and iPad, talking about Today at Apple, so this year we could get an update from Deidre O'Brien, including highlights from the 5th Ave. Apple Store grand re-opening. Or, since Lisa Jackson didn't make an appearance back in September, we could get an update on environment this October. Maybe Susan Prescott if there are any big iWork or Education announcements to fold in.</p>\n<p>And, while it still feels way too early for glasses, there are also rumors of over-the-ear AirPods \u2014 AirCans? \u2014 that have yet to see the light of\u2026 stage light.</p>\n<p>Some, none, or all of that could make an appearance before Tim comes out one last time to wrap everything up with a big...</p>\n<p>THANK YOU!</p>\n<p></p><div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector\">VECTOR | Rene Ritchie</a></h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/+lastest?list=PLOPlnaz0lJJhMap8KV2MeziTUwFkSls0A\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul><li>Video: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/vectorshow\">YouTube</a></li>\n<li>Podcast: <a href=\"http://applepodcasts.com/vector\">Apple</a> | <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1313368831/vector\">Overcast</a> | <a href=\"http://pca.st/vector\">Pocket Casts</a> | <a href=\"http://vector.libsyn.com/rss\">RSS</a></li>\n<li>Column: <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector\">iMore</a> | <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/vector/rss\">RSS</a></li>\n<li>Social: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reneritchie\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://instagram.com/reneritchie\">Instagram</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p></p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/mUTyeW28iPQ\" height=\"1\">",

After years of catching hard-earned Pok\u00e9mon from different games and wondering if we'd ever be able to use them again, the Pok\u00e9mon Company has come through with a new trading and storage system.</p>\n<p>During the 2019 Pok\u00e9mon Press Conference, Game Freak's director, Junichi Masuda announced a new cloud service called Pok\u00e9mon Home. It's a Pok\u00e9mon storage and trading service that works with the Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, and the 3DS storage system - <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pokemon-bank-3ds/\">Pok\u00e9mon Bank</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update: October 1, 2019: More Pok\u00e9mon confirmed for Sword and Shield.</h2>\n<p>We've updated the list of Pok\u00e9mon found in Gen 8.</p>\n<h2>Update: June 11, 2019: Only some Pok\u00e9mon can be transferred into Sword and Shield</h2>\n<p>During E3, Junichi Masuda of Game Freak announced via interpreter that only the Pok\u00e9mon that are in the Galar region Pok\u00e9dex can be transferred into the new games. This means you might not be able to play the new Switch games with your favorite monsters that you've caught elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>When will Pok\u00e9mon Home release?</h3>\n<p>This service launches in early 2020. We don't have any detailed information about the release date yet, but we'll update this article as we learn more.</p>\n<h3>How do you trade?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-home-everything-we-know-so-far\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Home: Everything we know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/05/pokemon-home-2.jpg?itok=PFeAMqTm\"></a></p>\n<p>This service will make it so you can trade with other Pok\u00e9mon players around the world or with people nearby using a smartphone. At the moment, it's unclear if you'll be able to trade using the Nintendo Switch.</p>\n<h3>What games are compatible with Pok\u00e9mon Home?</h3>\n<p>This is a somewhat tricky answer. The press conference stated that the service would work with Pok\u00e9mon Bank, Pok\u00e9mon GO, Let's Go Pikachu!, Let's Go, Eevee!, and the upcoming Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield games. If it's been awhile or if you aren't familiar, the 3DS handheld system's <strong>Pok\u00e9mon Bank</strong> allowed you to store up to 3,000 monsters from several games. This means that if you have a 3DS and use Pok\u00e9mon Bank, you'll be able to store monsters into Pok\u00e9mon Home from the many Pok\u00e9mon games available on 3DS, as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-home-everything-we-know-so-far\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Home: Everything we know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/05/pokemonswordshieldstarterpokemon.jpg?itok=y-whT9PS\"></a></p>\n<h3>Games that work with Pok\u00e9mon Home</h3>\n<ul><li>Pok\u00e9mon GO</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Eevee!</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Sword </li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Shield</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Bank</li>\n</ul><p>Now the thing is, <strong>Pok\u00e9mon Bank</strong> worked with a number of games from the 3DS system. However, some of the games could only deposit into Pok\u00e9mon Bank but couldn't receive transfers from the storage service. We're guessing that something similar will be put in place for Pok\u00e9mon Home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-home-everything-we-know-so-far\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Home: Everything we know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/05/3ds_pokemonbank-001.jpg?itok=EME4GtzD\"></a> The above image is for Pok\u00e9mon Bank, not Pok\u00e9mon Home.</p>\n<h3>Games that work with Pok\u00e9mon Bank on the 3DS</h3>\n<ul><li>Pok\u00e9mon Black</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon White</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Black Version 2</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon White Version 2</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Red (Virtual Console)</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Blue (Virtual Console) </li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Yellow (Virtual Console)</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Gold (Virtual Console)</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Silver (Virtual Console)</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Crystal (Virtual Console)</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon X </li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Y </li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Alpha Sapphire</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby </li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Sun </li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Moon</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun</li>\n<li>Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Moon</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-home-everything-we-know-so-far\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Home: Everything we know\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/05/pokemon-home.jpg?itok=JGo_DCVA\"></a></p>\n<h3>Transfer limitations</h3>\n<p>During the press conference the above image was shown. As you can see the direction for transferring a Pok\u00e9mon for the most part is one way. However, it looks like the only games you can transfer Pok\u00e9mon to is Sword and Shield.</p>\n<p>There are also limitations for which Pok\u00e9mon can be transferred into the new games. We learned during the E3 2019 Nintendo Treehouse livestream that you'll only be able to transfer a Pok\u00e9mon into Sword and Shield if that Pok\u00e9mon is in the Galar region Pok\u00e9dex. By scouring trailers and advertisements we've made a list of all the Pokemon from previous generations that we know to appear in the Sword and Shield gameplay. We'll update this as we learn more.</p>\n<ul><li>Abomasnow</li>\n<li>Arcanine</li>\n<li>Avalugg</li>\n<li>Axew</li>\n<li>Bergmite</li>\n<li>Bewear</li>\n<li>Boldore</li>\n<li>Bounsweet</li>\n<li>Braviary</li>\n<li>Bronzor</li>\n<li>Bronzong</li>\n<li>Budew</li>\n<li>Bunnelby</li>\n<li>Butterfree</li>\n<li>Charmander</li>\n<li>Charmeleon</li>\n<li>Charizard</li>\n<li>Charjabug</li>\n<li>Chinchou</li>\n<li>Cinccino</li>\n<li>Caterpie</li>\n<li>Cleffa</li>\n<li>Clefairy</li>\n<li>Clefable</li>\n<li>Combee</li>\n<li>Croagunk</li>\n<li>Deino</li>\n<li>Diggersby</li>\n<li>Diglett</li>\n<li>Drifloon</li>\n<li>Drifblim</li>\n<li>Dugtrio</li>\n<li>Duosion</li>\n<li>Dusknoir</li>\n<li>Dusclops</li>\n<li>Duskull</li>\n<li>Eevee</li>\n<li>Electrike</li>\n<li>Espeon</li>\n<li>Espurr</li>\n<li>Feebas</li>\n<li>Ferroseed</li>\n<li>Ferrothorn</li>\n<li>Flareon</li>\n<li>Flygon</li>\n<li>Fraxure</li>\n<li>Frillish</li>\n<li>Froslass</li>\n<li>Gallade</li>\n<li>Garbodor</li>\n<li>Galvantula</li>\n<li>Gardevoir</li>\n<li>Gastly</li>\n<li>Gengar </li>\n<li>Gigalith</li>\n<li>Glaceon</li>\n<li>Glalie</li>\n<li>Goldeen</li>\n<li>Golett</li>\n<li>Golisopod</li>\n<li>Golurk</li>\n<li>Goodra</li>\n<li>Goomy</li>\n<li>Gourgeist</li>\n<li>Growlithe</li>\n<li>Grubbin</li>\n<li>Gyrados</li>\n<li>Hakamo-o</li>\n<li>Haunter</li>\n<li>Hawlucha</li>\n<li>Haxorus</li>\n<li>Helioptile</li>\n<li>Heliolisk</li>\n<li>Hippopotas</li>\n<li>Hippowdon</li>\n<li>Hitmonchan</li>\n<li>Hitmonlee</li>\n<li>Hitmontop</li>\n<li>Hoothoot</li>\n<li>Hydreigon</li>\n<li>Inkay</li>\n<li>Jangmo-o</li>\n<li>Jellicent</li>\n<li>Jolteon</li>\n<li>Joltik</li>\n<li>Kirlia</li>\n<li>Koffing</li>\n<li>Kommo-o</li>\n<li>Lanturn</li>\n<li>Lapras</li>\n<li>Larvitar</li>\n<li>Leafeon</li>\n<li>Liepard</li>\n<li>Linoone</li>\n<li>Lombre</li>\n<li>Lotad</li>\n<li>Lucario</li>\n<li>Ludicolo</li>\n<li>Machop</li>\n<li>Machoke</li>\n<li>Machamp</li>\n<li>Magikarp</li>\n<li>Malamar</li>\n<li>Manectric</li>\n<li>Mantine</li>\n<li>Mantyke</li>\n<li>Maractus</li>\n<li>Mareanie</li>\n<li>Mawile</li>\n<li>Meowstic</li>\n<li>Metapod</li>\n<li>Mew</li>\n<li>Mimikyu</li>\n<li>Minccino</li>\n<li>Milotic</li>\n<li>Mudbray</li>\n<li>Mudsdale</li>\n<li>Munchlax</li>\n<li>Ninetales</li>\n<li>Noctowl</li>\n<li>Noibat</li>\n<li>Noivern</li>\n<li>Onix</li>\n<li>Palpitoad</li>\n<li>Pancham</li>\n<li>Pangoro</li>\n<li>Pelipper</li>\n<li>Pichu</li>\n<li>Pikachu</li>\n<li>Pumpkaboo</li>\n<li>Pupitar</li>\n<li>Purrloin</li>\n<li>Quagsire</li>\n<li>Raichu</li>\n<li>Ralts</li>\n<li>Reuniclus</li>\n<li>Rhydon</li>\n<li>Rhyperior</li>\n<li>Riolu</li>\n<li>Roggenrola</li>\n<li>Roselia</li>\n<li>Roserade</li>\n<li>Rufflet</li>\n<li>Sawk</li>\n<li>Scrappy</li>\n<li>Seaking</li>\n<li>Seismitoad</li>\n<li>Sliggoo</li>\n<li>Slurpuff</li>\n<li>Sneasel</li>\n<li>Snorlax</li>\n<li>Snover</li>\n<li>Solosis</li>\n<li>Steelix</li>\n<li>Stenee</li>\n<li>Stufful</li>\n<li>Swirlix</li>\n<li>Swoobat</li>\n<li>Sylveon</li>\n<li>Togepi</li>\n<li>Togetic</li>\n<li>Togekiss</li>\n<li>Toxapex</li>\n<li>Toxicroak</li>\n<li>Trapinch</li>\n<li>Trubbish</li>\n<li>Tsareena</li>\n<li>Tympole</li>\n<li>Tyranitar</li>\n<li>Tyrogue</li>\n<li>Umbreon</li>\n<li>Vanillite</li>\n<li>Vanillish</li>\n<li>Vanilluxe</li>\n<li>Vaporeon</li>\n<li>Vespiquen</li>\n<li>Vibrava</li>\n<li>Vikavolt</li>\n<li>Vulpix</li>\n<li>Wailmer</li>\n<li>Wailord</li>\n<li>Weavile</li>\n<li>Woobat</li>\n<li>Wooper</li>\n<li>Wobbuffet</li>\n<li>Wimpod</li>\n<li>Wingull</li>\n<li>Wishiwashi</li>\n<li>Wynaut</li>\n<li>Zwelious</li>\n</ul><p>What are your thoughts about this new service?

It's a Pok\u00e9mon storage and trading service that works with the Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, and the 3DS storage system - Pok\u00e9mon Bank.\nUpdate: October 1, 2019: More Pok\u00e9mon confirmed for Sword and Shield.\nWe've updated the list of Pok\u00e9mon found in Gen 8.\nUpdate: June 11, 2019: Only some Pok\u00e9mon can be transferred into Sword and Shield\nDuring E3, Junichi Masuda of Game Freak announced via interpreter that only the Pok\u00e9mon that are in the Galar region Pok\u00e9dex can be transferred into the new games.

Perhaps a sexy pirate? You can even be a sexy <a href=\"https://www.yandy.com/yandy-nicest-neighbor-costume.php\">Mr. Rogers</a>.<sup><a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2019/10/01/ridiculous-products-sexy-beyond-burger-costume/#fn2-20191001-sexybeyond\">2</a></sup> You know you have to be some kind of sexy, and the options are nearly limitless in the awfulness that is 2019.</p>\n<p>New this year is a <a href=\"https://www.yandy.com/yandy-beyond-burger-costume.php\">sexy Beyond Burger costume</a>. This is problematic in multiple ways. In addition to its name likely being a trademark violation, it\u2019s also the sexualization of a veggie burger. That\u2019s more than a little bizarre, which I suppose pretty standard when it comes to modern costumes.</p>\n<p><img alt srcset=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20191001-sexybeyond/fullcostume@2x.jpg 2x\" src=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20191001-sexybeyond/fullcostume.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Initially, I thought the bestworst<sup><a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2019/10/01/ridiculous-products-sexy-beyond-burger-costume/#fn3-20191001-sexybeyond\">3</a></sup> part of the whole thing was the headband. Multiple fake meat purveyors have had restaurants place <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BauDoXzhMPL/\">little</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhAZLXEH7g_/\">flags</a> on their burgers, to serve as a tiny form of advertising. This costume goes with the more generic \u201cplant based\u201d phrase, which has become incredibly trendy in 2019, but the idea is the same.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20191001-sexybeyond/plantbasedheadband.jpg\"></p>\n<p>However, this implies 1) That your brain is plant-based, which sounds sort of like an insult, and 2) That there\u2019s a massive toothpick stuck right through your skull. The latter is actually rather on-point for a proper, scary Halloween costume, so maybe this horrible idea could be redeemed with a bit of stage makeup and effects.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no redeeming the actual worst part though, which is this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A stamp on the rear end of the costume says 'Certified Not Grade A'.\" src=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20191001-sexybeyond/notgradea.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I guess the thinking was that since it\u2019s not animal meat, your ass can\u2019t be Grade A. But like the plant based brain, this too looks like an insult to the wearer. How about \u201cCertified: Better Than Grade A\u201d? Or \u201cCertified: Hot!\u201d. Anything would be better than this. Also, your ass kind of <em>is</em> animal meat, when you get right down to it.</p>\n<p>This one detail alone is almost as bad as the previously featured <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/index.php?s=socks\">Bad Ass socks</a>. The total of all of it is much worse.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Alternately or synonymously, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PBones/status/528270917622046720?tw_i=528270917622046720&tw_e=details&tw_p=archive\">slutty</a>\u201d <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2019/10/01/ridiculous-products-sexy-beyond-burger-costume/#fnr1-20191001-sexybeyond\" title=\"Jump back to footnote in the text.\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p></li>\n<li><p>This may be a new low, and even more ridiculous than the Beyond costume.

Sword and Shield breaks this tradition by doing away with the Elite Four and replacing it with something called the Champion Cup.</p>\n<h3>Update: September 4, 2019: Pok\u00e9mon Camp, Curry Dex, and character customization options revealed</h3>\n<p>During the Nintendo Direct, we learned that you can camp at any time during the game to bond with your Pok\u00e9mon and raise their battle skills. You can even camp with up to three other players and interact with their Pok\u00e9mon. We also got to see some additional character customization options, including hairstyles, clothes, and accessories.</p>\n<h3>Update: August 7, 2019: New Galarian forms, additional rivals, and Pok\u00e9 Jobs revealed</h3>\n<p>A new video revealed that some Pokemon will have Galarian forms in Sword and Shield, similar to Alolan forms from Sun and Moon. The main antagonists will be Team Yell, a group of fans, which you'll encounter throughout the game. Finally, players will be able to view job boards and send their Pok\u00e9mon off to complete tasks. In exchange, Pok\u00e9mon will earn experience points.</p>\n<h3>Update: June 11, 2019: New information from E3 - Only certain Pok\u00e9mon can be transferred into Sword and Shield | Fighting wild Pok\u00e9mon is back!</h3>\n<p>During Nintendo Treehouse live stream, Junichi Masuda stated via interpreter that you'll only be able to transfer a Pok\u00e9mon into Sword and Shield if it is in the Galar region Pok\u00e9dex. We were also told that while exploring the Galar region, players will be able to fight wild Pok\u00e9mon. This element of the game was missing from the last Pok\u00e9mon Switch games, so we're happy to see it has returned.</p>\n<h3>Update: June 5, 2019: Nintendo Direct presentation reveals multiplayer co-op raids, new Pok\u00e9mon, Legendaries, Dynamax battles, and more</h3>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/06-05-2019/\">15-minute Nintendo Direct presentation</a> on Wednesday, we got a lot of new info on the upcoming Sword and Shield. We saw how Pok\u00e9mon battles will work in the Galar region and also got a peek at some new monsters. Additionally, we were introduced to Dynamax battles and a new co-op raid mode, which makes the new titles similar in some respects to Pok\u00e9mon Go. Here's everything we know so far:</p>\n<h2>What are Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield?</h2>\n<div><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdA22Lh6Rwk?modestbranding=0&html5=1&rel=0&autoplay=0&wmode=opaque&loop=0&controls=1&autohide=0&showinfo=0&theme=dark&color=red&enablejsapi=1\" width=\"627\" height=\"400\"></iframe></div></div>\n\n<p>After teasing a proper, mainline Pok\u00e9mon RPG last year, Game Freak has finally revealed Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield. Pok\u00e9mon Let's Go took cues from the mobile game Pok\u00e9mon GO and streamlined the experience to be more accessible for everyone. Sword and Shield, on the other hand, appears to be the more like traditional Pok\u00e9mon games that you've grown to love.</p>\n<p>New Pok\u00e9mon, new gym battles, new cities, and new challenges await. If it's anything like previous titles, you can probably expect a new team of villains as well.</p>\n<h2>What region do they take place in?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/02/pokemon-sword-and-shield-full-galar-map.jpg?itok=JBZX9hz6\"></a></p>\n<p>Generation 8 takes place in the entirely new Galar Region, which appears to be based on England. As the Pok\u00e9mon Company states, this region is &quot;filled with idyllic countryside and contemporary cities\u2014vast plains and snow-covered mountains.&quot;</p>\n<p>We don't know the names of any major cities or towns yet, but the region map that Game Freak revealed in the trailer gives us a lot to look forward to. According to Game Director Shigeru Ohmori, Pok\u00e9mon and Galar's citizens work together closely to develop the region's industries.</p>\n<h2>What starters can I choose from?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/02/pokemon-sword-and-shield-starters.jpg?itok=aqYKHa6G\"></a></p>\n<p>Game Freak revealed all three starter Pok\u00e9mon that players can choose from in Sword and Shield. As seen above, they are Grookey, the chimp Pok\u00e9mon; Scorbunny, the rabbit Pok\u00e9mon; and Sobble, the water lizard Pok\u00e9mon.</p>\n<p>They're not ugly! We'll have to wait and see their evolutions, but for now, we get this cute trio to enjoy. Maybe we won't have a Popplio situation this time, the poor ugly duckling.</p>\n<h2>Can I catch Pok\u00e9mon from other regions?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/02/pokemon-sword-and-shield-pikachu.jpg?itok=SGWS7Fz4\"></a></p>\n<p>Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield's complete Pok\u00e9dex hasn't been revealed just yet, but going from the trailer players will be able to catch Pok\u00e9mon from other regions. A random encounter with a Pikachu was shown at one point along with Generation 2 and 3 Pok\u00e9mon like Wailmer, Flygon, Hoothoot, Tyranitar, and a whole lot more.</p>\n<h2>Which Pok\u00e9mon can I transfer into Sword and Shield?</h2>\n<p>During the 2019 Pok\u00e9mon Press Conference, we learned that Sword and Shield will work with Pok\u00e9mon Home, a cloud service that allows you to store and trade Pok\u00e9mon. We got a little more information about this feature at E3, and it isn't good. According to Junichi Masuda of Game Freak, only Pok\u00e9mon that are specifically in the Galar region Pok\u00e9dex can get transferred into the new Switch games. This means that some of your favorite creatures that you've captured in previous games won't be usable in Gen 8.</p>\n<p>For more information on which Pok\u00e9mon you can use in Sword and Shield, check out our article on <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-home-everything-we-know-so-far\">Pokemon Home</a>.</p>\n<h2>How will Pok\u00e9mon encounters work?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-3_0.jpg?itok=F5SRZ7XI\"></a></p>\n<p>As in previous Pok\u00e9mon games, players will come across monsters in tall grass and caves when wandering about in the world. The Pok\u00e9mon you encounter will be random, but you'll be able to tell that a creature is nearby when you see an exclamation point icon on the screen. The ability to fight wild Pok\u00e9mon is back! This battle element of the games was missing from Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, so we're happy to see that it's still a feature in the newest core games.</p>\n<p><strong>The Wild Area:</strong> In a sprawling section of the Galar region, the Pokemon you encounter will be determined by in-game weather and your location on the map. Pokemon in this section wander freely, and you can attract them by whistling, which will be especially helpful for attracting high-flying creatures.</p>\n<h2>Can I customize my character?</h2>\n<div><div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2019/06/capture.jpg?itok=ojyAQecl\"></div><div data-title=\"\" data-big=\"/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2019/09/pokemon-sword-and-shield-007.jpg?itok=YXHco02U\"></div></div> </div>\n<p>There are eight different characters to choose from \u2014 four boys and four girls. At various points throughout the game, you'll be able to get different outfits and accessories to customize the look of your character. However, you'll start with one of the eight stock looks. In addition to tops and pants, you can choose your hairstyle, eye color, and can even wear makeup.</p>\n<h2>What is Dynamax in Sword and Shield?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-14.jpg?itok=MdPvZoZ-\"></a></p>\n<p>The Nintendo Direct presentation on June 5 revealed a new way to battle that involves making your Pok\u00e9mon huge and more powerful. Players will only be able to use this ability once per battle, and the Pokemon will only remain in its Dynamax form for three consecutive turns before returning to normal. Dynamaxing can be done during gym battles, raids, and trainer battles. According to the presentation, you'll need to master Dynamaxing if you want to become a full-fledged trainer.</p>\n<h2>What is Gigantamaxing in Sword and Shield?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/pokemon-sword-and-shield-009.jpg?itok=BGmIzevK\"></a></p>\n<p>It's similar to Dynamaxing where the Pok\u00e9mon grows incredibly large. However, Gigantamaxing also changes a Pok\u00e9mon's appearance and gives the Pok\u00e9mon a special G-Max move as well. One of the most significant Gigantamax appearance changes we've seen so far is with Alcremie, which has a humongous tiered cake spawn beneath it, with Alcremie serving as the top layer of cream.</p>\n<p>Another important thing to note is that while all Pok\u00e9mon can Dynamax, only special Pok\u00e9mon can Gigantamax. For instance, Drednaw can Dynamax, but only special Drednaw can Gigantamax. I know, it's a little confusing. We're not sure how you'll be able to tell if a Pok\u00e9mon can Gigantamax at present, but we'll add this information when we learn more.</p>\n<h2>What's this I hear about a new multiplayer raid mode?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-shield-9.jpg?itok=iL22ZaED\"></a></p>\n<p>With Gen 8 comes Max Raid Battles, which let you and up to three others battle a giant, wild Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon together. You'll be able to play with nearby friends using local wireless play. However, they each need to have their own copy of the game and their own console. You can also participate in raids with other online players as long as you have a Nintendo Switch Online membership.</p>\n<p>You'll need to strategize with your fellow raiders since only one of you will be able to use the Dynamax form on your Pok\u00e9mon. Max Raid Battles take place in the Wild Area, a large section of the map that stretches between towns.</p>\n<h2>What are Galarian forms?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/08/pokemon-sword-and-shield-001.jpg?itok=UBTmrDmB\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/08/pokemon-sword-and-shield-002.jpg?itok=HavdwuQF\"></a></p>\n<p>Similar to the Alolan forms found in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, players will encounter Pok\u00e9mon that look different in the Galar region. We've gotten a brief glimpse at a dapper Galarian Weezing who gives off a Victorian vibe with his top hat-like chimney stacks. We've also seen a Galarian Zigzagoon and Galarian Linoone variant that give off a strong Kiss vibe. What's more, in the Galar region you might find unique evolutions that aren't available elsewhere. For example, the Obstagoon that evolves from Galarian Linoone or the Sword exclusive evolution of Sirfetch'd that evolves from Farfetch'd.</p>\n<h2>Who are the team antagonists?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/08/pokemon-sword-and-shield-003.jpg?itok=14k2-wuc\"></a></p>\n<p>If you're at all familiar with previous Pok\u00e9mon games, you know that there's always an opposing group of people that the main character encounters throughout their journey. So far, we know that a goth-looking Marnie has some crazy fans known as Team Yell who disrupt battles and cause general trouble for the inhabitants of the Galar region.</p>\n<h2>What is Pok\u00e9mon Camp?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/pokemon-camp-sword-shield.jpg?itok=7cR54OEN\"></a></p>\n<p>Players will have the ability to take their Pokemon out into the wild for some good old fashion bonding. As you get to know your Pokemon better, they will improve in battle. While in the Wild Area you'll also be able to visit other players and their Pokemon. Up to four characters can interact in a Pokemon Camp at a time.</p>\n<p>While camping, you can cook up curry creations using various ingredients. Each time you discover a new recipe, it gets added to your Curry Dex. There are 100 recipes to discover. We're guessing that these tasty creations can be used to influence a Pokemon's battle stats, but we don't know for sure.</p>\n<h2>What are Pok\u00e9 Jobs?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/08/pokemon-sword-and-shield-004.jpg?itok=USWew1aS\"></a><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/08/pokemon-sword-and-shield-005.jpg?itok=sYmYkUvv\"></a></p>\n<p>By accessing the Rotomi, in Pok\u00e9mon Centers players will be able to send their Pok\u00e9mon off to complete jobs for businesses and universities. In return, your Pok\u00e9mon can earn experience and rare items. Some pocket monsters are better suited for specific jobs so you'll want to think about which ones you send. This seems like it will be a great way to help level up Pok\u00e9mon that aren't currently in your party.</p>\n<h2>What differences will there be between the two versions?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/02/pokemon-sword-and-shield-gameplay.jpg?itok=hfHEhYcS\"></a></p>\n<p>We don't know all the differences between the two versions just yet, but we do know that a handful of Pok\u00e9mon can only be caught in either Sword or Shield. We also know that those who purchase Sword will be able to encounter the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Zacian, while those who buy Shield will meet Zamazenta.</p>\n<h2>What's this I hear about there being no Elite Four?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/09/pokemon-sword-and-shield-008.jpg?itok=gsVchM--\"></a></p>\n<p>Yes, it's true. Sword and Shield is the first core Pok\u00e9mon game that won't have you battling the Elite Four after beating all of the gym leaders in the region. Instead, players will enter the Champion Cup where they'll have the chance to battle the current Champion, Leon and his Charizard. Leon is the older brother of your in-game rival, Hop. So, you'll probably hear a lot about the Champion before you meet him.</p>\n<p>Here's what the <a href=\"https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/story/strive-to-become-next-champion/\">Pok\u00e9mon website</a> says about the Champion Cup:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once a year in the Galar region, a series of Pok\u00e9mon battles are held with the League Championship on the line.</p>\n<p>This is the Champion Cup! The Champion Cup is the tournament to decide who will be able to challenge the reigning Champion for their seat. Exemplary Trainers throughout the region, such as those who complete the Gym Challenge, are allowed to participate in the Champion Cup tournament.</p>\n<p>The Champion Cup battles are broadcast on TV, and all the people of the Galar region will be watching!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We're unsure if there will be different rules in the Champion's Cup compared to when facing off with the Elite Four, but we'll update this section when we learn more.</p>\n<h2>When can I play them?</h2>\n<p>Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield will be releasing for the Nintendo Switch worldwide on November 15, 2019. They're currently available for pre-order at Amazon.</p>\n<h3>Go for attack</h3>\n<h4>Pok\u00e9mon Sword</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield\" title=\"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield: Release date, trailers, &amp; announcements\"><img src=\"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/06/pokemon-sword-game.jpg?itok=XLHO7epP\"></a></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Sword-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07PC7X38X/?tag=imoreb-20&ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU51235YYr\" title=\"\">$60 at Amazon</a></p>\n<p>The latest Pok\u00e9mon adventure</p>\n<p>Pok\u00e9mon Sword is one of the two latest Pok\u00e9mon adventures.

Giving the Apple II and Apple II Plus a clear plastic home is the right thing to do. We're just glad someone's doing it.

I asked Siri to play a &quot;radio station&quot;, and was immediately treated to the sound of Beats 1. However, if you ask Siri to play a <em>local</em> radio station, this seems to be functioning. It's unclear exactly which station I am listening to currently, the station was described as &quot;Local FM&quot;, which isn't a real broadcaster where I live. This may simply be a generic term at this stage. When &quot;Why?&quot; by Bronski Beat started to play I desperately tried to change to a different station, but my efforts were to no avail. As such is seems the number of stations on offer at the moment is quite limited.</p>\n<p>HomePod users in the U.K. will not be able to listen to any BBC Radio stations, which have been removed from TuneIn's catalogue by the BBC after the U.S. firm refused to share information about its listeners with the broadcaster.</p>\n<p>So it seems then that HomePod's local radio feature does seem to be working, at least tentatively at this stage. As mentioned previously, to get it to work you must specify that you want Siri to play a <em>local</em> radio station, otherwise you'll just end up with Beats 1.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/3lHUP-r4snc\" height=\"1\">",

We got a taste last night of how well the kids learned from their father, and how they can work together when they are offended in the same way.

The move is almost certainly a direct counter to previous action taken against TMSC last month.</p>\n<p>In August of this year, GlobalFoundries sued TSMC over the alleged infringement of 16 of its patents. That lawsuit sought to stop imports into the U.S and Germany of all products containing the technology in question. The firm claimed that Apple was amongst the TSMC customers whose products were affected by the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Regarding the latest civil action, TSMC said this:</p>\n<p><em>TSMC, the world's leading global innovator in semiconductor manufacturing, filed multiple lawsuits on September 30, 2019 against GlobalFoundries in the United States, Germany and Singapore for its ongoing infringement of 25 TSMC patents by at least its 40nm, 28nm, 22nm, 14nm, and 12nm node processes. In the complaints, TSMC demands injunctions to stop GlobalFoundries' manufacture and sale of infringing semiconductor products. TSMC also seeks substantial monetary damages from GlobalFoundries for its sale of infringing semiconductor products and unlawful use of TSMC's patented semiconductor technologies.</em></p>\n<p>Whilst this development in the legal dispute does seem to cloud the air somewhat, it may in fact increase the likelihood that the two parties, TSMC and GlobalFoundries, may be able to find some common ground or terms of settlement. Were that the case, both lawsuits might fall away, preventing what would likely be a fairly catastrophic blow to Apple's U.S. sales market and months of expensive and protracted litigation.</p></div></div></div><img width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/sJaqh4uvAME\" height=\"1\">",

                "content": "<p>When I was a kid, we had a kitten named Rab. She was thus called because she was small, fluffy, white, and tail-less \u2013 like a rabbit. She was endearing and snuggly and prosh, or at least she was when she wasn\u2019t drinking from the toilet bowl. Even as an adult, she stayed small and roughly spherical. To us, she was still a kitten.</p>\n<p>One day, our kitten had kittens. So turns the circle of life. The litter was scrawny and stumbly, and blind enough that they\u2019d attempt to suck milk from the olive green strands of our old shag rug.</p>\n<p>As they grew, they got a lot cuter and a little less clumsy. As cute as they were, though, they weren\u2019t the least bit cuddly. You could get one second of snuggle in, perhaps two, before they\u2019d promptly mew and squirm \u2013 all they wanted to do was climb and play.</p>\n<p>A few weeks into this, very late one night I was woken by a mewing pile of kittens in my bed. A pleasant surprise! As I blearily moved to let Rab lead them under the covers, I discovered that they were distinctly cold, wet, and shivering. Confused but dutiful, I did my best to help her warm them up, and soon fell back asleep.</p>\n<p>The next morning, it promptly became clear what had happened. Rab, in her wisdom and stubbornness, had decided to drink from the side of the toilet in the middle the night. The kittens, in their curiosity and adventurousness, jumped up \u2013 and directly into \u2013 the bowl. Mama then taught them a critical lesson in leeching body heat from an unsuspecting human.</p>\n<p>Disgusting, but endearing. Like much of parenting, I suppose.</p>\n<p>As a parent, I do my best to teach my daughter well, and to keep her from harm. From time to time though, I slip up. I notice her copying behavior I wish I hadn\u2019t modeled. I get overconfident in her climbing ability and she knocks her tooth on the pavement. Or, most recently, I give in and let her watch a cartoon that\u2019s a little too scary. (Apparently we\u2019re not born with the innate knowledge that \u201cthe floor is lava\u201d is not likely to actually occur.)</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a way to totally prevent these transgressions, I don\u2019t know what it is. Nor is that a goal worth having, honestly. Letting kids slip up is a fundamental part of their education.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s important is, when that happens, we take care of them. We lead them to warmth, and give them comfort. Even if it\u2019s a little gross.</p>\n<p>And with luck, seeing my habits and mannerisms reflected in my child will continue to give me the perspective to better myself. The strength to choose my words thoughtfully, and be the person I\u2019d like her to one day be. To stop drinking from the toilet.</p>\n<p>Rab, mind you, she was unstoppable. Still, she was a good mom. You could just tell.</p>"
