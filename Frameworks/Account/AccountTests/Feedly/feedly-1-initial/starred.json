height=\"200\"></a></div><div><span>One of the key themes of the early modern philosophers\u2019 revolt against Scholasticism was a move away from an Aristotelian hylemorphist conception of the nature of physical substance to some variation or other of the mechanical philosophy.\u00a0 The other day I was asked a very interesting question: Can transubstantiation be formulated in terms of a mechanistic conception of physical substance rather than a hylemorphic one?\u00a0 My answer was that I would not peremptorily say that it cannot be, but that the suggestion certainly raises serious philosophical and theological problems.</span></div><a name=\"more\"></a><br> <div><span>Here\u2019s why.<span>\u00a0 </span>Hylemorphism in its most straightforward version roughly agrees with common sense about which of the things of everyday experience are distinct substances, which are different parts of the same substance, and which are aggregates rather than true substances.<span>\u00a0 </span>For example, it would say that a stone, a tree, and a dog are all distinct substances from one another; that a particular dog\u2019s nose and its right front leg are different parts of the same substance rather than distinct substances; and that a pile of stones is an aggregate rather than a substance in its own right.<span>\u00a0 </span>Of course, use of the term \u201csubstance\u201d in the technical Aristotelian sense isn\u2019t part of common sense, but even untutored common sense would surely involve the supposition that a stone, a tree, and a dog are all distinct <i>things</i> or <i>objects</i>, that the nose and leg of the dog are parts of a larger thing or object rather than separate things or objects, and that a pile of stones is a bunch of things or objects rather than a single object.<span>\u00a0 </span>At least to that extent, common sense would more or less agree with what I am calling a straightforward version of hylemorphism. <span>\u00a0</span>(See chapter 3 of <i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Scholastic-Metaphysics-A-Contemporary-Introduction/dp/3868385444/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391482601&sr=8-1&keywords=scholastic+metaphysics+a+contemporary+introduction\">Scholastic Metaphysics</a></i> for exposition and defense of the hylemorphist account of substance.)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Now, the mechanical world picture that pushed aside the hylemorphist model tended radically to revise the common sense understanding of physical objects in one of two general ways, depending on how mechanism was spelled out.<span>\u00a0 </span>It reduced ordinary physical objects either to mere aggregates of their innumerably many component parts, or to mere modes of some larger blob of which <i>they</i>were the parts.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Descartes and Spinoza essentially took the latter option.<span>\u00a0 </span>Though Descartes is often described as positing a plurality of extended substances alongside the plurality of thinking substances, his considered view seemed to be that strictly speaking, there is only a single extended substance, of which the ordinary objects of our experience are merely modifications.<span>\u00a0 </span>Spinoza more famously took such a position (or rather, he took it that <i>Deus sive Natura</i>was the one substance of which the ordinary physical objects of our experience are all modes).<span>\u00a0 </span>On this view, a stone, a tree, and a dog are not really distinct substances, but merely distinct aspects of one and the same substance \u2013 in something like the way common sense regards the color, weight, and shape of a stone to be mere modes of one and the same object, the stone.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Atomist and corpuscularian versions of the mechanical philosophy went in the other direction.<span>\u00a0 </span>They essentially make either atoms or corpuscles the true substances, and ordinary objects mere aggregates of these purported substances.<span>\u00a0 </span>Just as a pile of rocks is not a true substance but merely a collection of substances (or as the hylemorphist would say, being a pile of rocks is a merely accidental form rather than a substantial form), so too a stone, a tree, or a dog is on this view merely a collection of particles.<span>\u00a0 </span>In effect, the particles are the true substances, and the stone, tree, or dog is like the pile \u2013 a relatively superficial arrangement of metaphysically more fundamental entities.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>So, to come to transubstantiation, the idea, of course, is that in the Eucharist, while the accidents of bread and wine remain, the substance of bread and wine are miraculously replaced with that of Christ.<span>\u00a0 </span>Suppose, then, that we were to adopt Descartes\u2019 version of the mechanical philosophy, on which there is just one big physical substance underlying all the things ordinary perceptual experience reveals to us.<span>\u00a0 </span>That would entail that the substance that underlies the accidents of bread and wine that are about to be consecrated is the very same substance as that which underlies stones, trees, dogs, cats, human bodies, apples, oranges, the sun, the moon, water, lead, gold, and every other thing we see, hear, taste, touch, or smell.<span>\u00a0 </span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>But in that case, when transubstantiation occurs, it is not just the substance underlying the accidents of bread and wine that is replaced, but the substance underlying all of these other things too.<span>\u00a0 </span>In other words, after transubstantiation occurs, it is really the body and blood of Christ that underlies what we perceive as stones, trees, dogs, cats, human bodies, the sun, the moon, water, etc.!<span>\u00a0 </span><i>Everything</i> in the physical world would be transubstantiated.<span>\u00a0 </span>We would be left with a kind of pantheism.<span>\u00a0 </span>Absolutely <i>every</i> physical thing would have to treated with the same reverence that the Eucharist is, because every physical thing would be the Eucharist!</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Another bizarre implication of this is that transubstantiation could occur only once.<span>\u00a0 </span>For only at the first time it occurs is the one physical substance replaced by that of Christ.<span>\u00a0 </span>If a priest were ever to try to consecrate bread and wine again, he would fail, because there is no longer any physical substance there to <i>be</i> replaced.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is <i>already</i>the body and blood of Christ.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Suppose we went the other route, that of either atomism or corpuscularianism.<span>\u00a0 </span>Then, like stones, trees, and dogs, bread and wine would not be true substances but merely accidental collections of innumerably many true substances.<span>\u00a0 </span>They would be like a pile of rocks, only instead it would be fundamental particles (atoms or corpuscles, depending on your favored version of the mechanical philosophy) that would be piled up.<span>\u00a0 </span>But in that case, exactly <i>what </i>is the substance that is replaced when transubstantiation occurs?<span>\u00a0 </span>Neither the substance of the bread nor that of the wine can be what is replaced, because on this view they just <i>aren\u2019t</i>true substances in the first place.<span>\u00a0 </span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>Should we say that it is each particle that makes up the aggregate that is transubstantiated (just as Catholic theology allows that many hosts at a time may be consecrated at Mass)?<span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span>But there are several problems with that suggestion.<span>\u00a0 </span>The first is that it is hard to know how to give a principled answer to the question what the <i>boundaries</i> are between those particles that make up the aggregate and those that are not part of it \u2013 and thus between those particles that are transubstantiated, and those that are not.<span>\u00a0 </span>The reason is that the boundaries of an aggregate are much less well defined than those of a substance.<span>\u00a0 </span>Is a stone that is two millimeters away from a pile of stones itself part of the pile or not?<span>\u00a0 </span>And is a particle that falls from the host part of <i>that</i> (purported) aggregate of particles or not?<span>\u00a0 </span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>If we think of the host on the model of an Aristotelian <i>substance</i>, then we can say that a fallen particle is part of the host, like a body part that has been severed, as it were.<span>\u00a0 </span>But, again, if instead we think in terms of the model of a pile of stones or some other aggregate, the answer isn\u2019t as clear.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>A second problem is that in Catholic theology, not any old matter can be used when consecrating the Eucharist.<span>\u00a0 </span>It has to be bread and wine, specifically.<span>\u00a0 </span>But on the interpretation under consideration, according to which bread and wine are not true substances, it is really the particles (either atoms or corpuscles) that are being consecrated.<span>\u00a0 </span>And the atoms or corpuscles that make up bread and wine are essentially the same as those that make up everything else (just as the stones that make up a pile can be essentially of the same type as those that are used instead to make up a wall).<span>\u00a0 </span>In that case, though, it would be hard to see why there is anything special about bread and wine.<span>\u00a0 </span>Why couldn\u2019t <i>any</i> old physical thing be consecrated, if every physical thing is essentially just the same kind of stuff in relatively superficial differences of configuration?</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>A third problem is that canon law says that a Catholic ought to receive communion at most only once (or in some special circumstances, perhaps twice) a day.<span>\u00a0 </span>But on the interpretation under consideration, one would in effect be consuming <i>millions</i> of consecrated hosts insofar as each of the millions of particles that make up what common sense regards as a single host was being independently transubstantiated.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Perhaps such problems could be solved, though I am doubtful.\u00a0 Anyway, the issue illustrates the unexpected implications that philosophical assumptions can have for theology.\u00a0 (And thus the caution that any Catholic ought to exercise before embracing philosophical novelties.\u00a0 The Scholastics knew what they were doing.)</span></div>"

(p. 85)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>In addition to shared values and religion, John Paul identifies shared history as another crucial aspect of a nation\u2019s identifying culture:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i><span>Like individuals, then, nations are endowed with historical memory\u2026 And the histories of nations, objectified and recorded in writing, are among the essential elements of culture \u2013 the element which determines the nation\u2019s identity in the temporal dimension</span></i><span>.<span>\u00a0 </span>(pp. 73-74)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The pope notes that citizens of modern Western European countries often have \u201creservations\u201d about the notion of \u201cnational identity as expressed through culture,\u201d and have even \u201carrived at a stage which could be defined as \u2018post-identity\u2019\u201d (p. 86).<span>\u00a0 </span>There is \u201ca widespread tendency to move toward supranational structures, even internationalism\u201d with \u201csmall nations\u2026 allow[ing] themselves to be absorbed into larger political structures\u201d (p. 66).<span>\u00a0 </span>However, the disappearance of the nation would be contrary to the natural order of things:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i><span>Yet it still seems that nation and native land, like the family, are permanent realities.<span>\u00a0 </span>In this regard, Catholic social doctrine speaks of \u201cnatural\u201d societies, indicating that both the family and the nation have a particular bond with human nature, which has a social dimension.<span>\u00a0 </span>Every society\u2019s formation takes place in and through the family: of this there can be no doubt.<span>\u00a0 </span>Yet something similar could also be said about the nation</span></i><span>. (p. 67)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>And again:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i><span>The term \u201cnation\u201d designates a community based in a given territory and distinguished from other nations by its culture.<span>\u00a0 </span>Catholic social doctrine holds that the family and the nation are both natural societies, not the product of mere convention.<span>\u00a0 </span>Therefore, in human history they cannot be replaced by anything else.<span>\u00a0 </span>For example, the nation cannot be replaced by the State, even though the nation tends naturally to establish itself as a State\u2026 Still less is it possible to identify the nation with so-called democratic society, since here it is a case of two distinct, albeit interconnected orders.<span>\u00a0 </span>Democratic society is closer to the State than is the nation.<span>\u00a0 </span>Yet the nation is the ground on which the State is born</span></i><span>. (pp. 69-70)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>As this last point about the state and democracy indicates, a nation cannot be defined in terms of, or replaced by, either governmental institutions and their laws and policies on the one hand, or the aggregate of the attitudes of individual citizens on the other.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is something deeper than, and presupposed by, both of these things.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is only insofar as a nation, defined by its culture, is already in place that a polity can come into being.<span>\u00a0 </span>Hence it is a mistake to think that, if the common cultural bonds that define a nation disappear, the nation can still be held together by virtue of governmental policy either imposed from above or arrived at my majority vote.<span>\u00a0 </span>For a people have to be united by common bonds of culture before they can all see either governmental policy or the will of the majority as legitimate.<span>\u00a0 </span>(Readers familiar with the work of Roger Scruton will note the parallels, and how deeply conservative John Paul II\u2019s understanding of the nation is.)<span>\u00a0 </span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>Now, as a natural institution, the nation, like the family, is necessary for our well-being.<span>\u00a0 </span>And as with the family, this entails a <i>moral duty</i> to be loyal to and to defend one\u2019s nation \u2013 and for precisely the same sorts of reasons one has a duty of loyalty to and defense of one\u2019s family:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i><span>If we ask where patriotism appears in the Decalogue, the reply comes without hesitation: it is covered by the fourth commandment, which obliges us to honor our father and mother.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is included under the umbrella of the Latin word </span></i><span>pietas<i>, which underlines the religious dimension of the respect and veneration due to parents\u2026</i></span></div><div><span><i><br></i></span></div><div><i><span>Patriotism is a love for everything to do with our native land: its history, its traditions, its language, its natural features.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is a love which extends also to the works of our compatriots and the fruits of their genius.<span>\u00a0 </span>Every danger that threatens the overall good of our native land becomes an occasion to demonstrate this love</span></i><span>. (pp. 65-66)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Among the dangers to the nation are the opposite extreme economic errors of egalitarian statism and liberal individualism, which threaten to destroy the common culture that defines the nation \u2013 in the one case from the top down and in the other from the bottom up.<span>\u00a0 </span>The pope writes:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i><span>[W]e must ask how best to respect the proper relationship between economics and culture without destroying this greater human good for the sake of profit, in deference to the overwhelming power of one-sided market forces.<span>\u00a0 </span>It matters little, in fact, whether this kind of tyranny is imposed by Marxist totalitarianism or by Western liberalism</span></i><span>. (pp. 83-84)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If liberal individualism is an error that pays insufficient respect to the nation, there is of course an opposite extreme error which involves giving excessive esteem to the nation \u2013 namely, nationalism.<span>\u00a0 </span>Patriotism, rightly understood, is the middle ground between these extremes:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i><span>Whereas nationalism involves recognizing and pursuing the good of one\u2019s own nation alone, without regard for the rights of others, patriotism, on the other hand, is a love for one\u2019s native land that accords rights to all other nations equal to those claimed for one\u2019s own</span></i><span>. (p. 67)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>John Paul II was clear that the remedy for nationalism was not to go to the opposite extreme (whether in the name of individualism, internationalism, or whatever), but rather precisely to insist on the sober middle ground:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i><span>How can we be delivered from such a danger?<span>\u00a0 </span>I think the right way is through patriotism\u2026 Patriotism, in other words, leads to a properly ordered social love</span></i><span>. (p. 67)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Now, let\u2019s note a number of things about these remarks and their implications.<span>\u00a0 </span>First, as I have said, what the late pope was giving expression to here is not merely his personal opinion, but traditional natural law political philosophy and Catholic moral teaching \u2013 the kind of thing that would have been well known to someone formed in Thomistic philosophy and theology in the early twentieth century, as John Paul II was.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Second, John Paul\u2019s teaching implies that those who seek to preserve their nation\u2019s common culture, and for that reason are concerned about trends that might radically alter its religious makeup or undermine its common language and reverence for its history, are simply following a natural and healthy human impulse and indeed following out the implications of the fourth commandment.<span>\u00a0 </span>There is no necessary connection between this attitude and racism, hatred for immigrants, religious bigotry, or the like.<span>\u00a0 </span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>Of course, a person who seeks to preserve his nation\u2019s culture <i>might</i> also be a racist or xenophobe or bigot.<span>\u00a0 </span>The point, however, is that he <i>need not</i> be, and indeed that it is wrong even to <i>presume</i> that he is, because a special love for one\u2019s own nation and desire to preserve its culture is a natural human tendency, and thus likely to be found even in people who have no racist or xenophobic or bigoted attitudes at all.<span>\u00a0 </span>Indeed, it is, again, even morally virtuous.<span>\u00a0 </span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>Needless to say, there is <i>also</i> a moral need to balance this patriotism with a welcoming attitude toward immigrants, with respect for the rights of religious minorities, and so forth.<span>\u00a0 </span>The point, however, is that <i>all </i>of these things need to be balanced. <span>\u00a0</span>Too many contemporary Catholics, including some churchmen, have a tendency to emphasize only the latter while ignoring the former.<span>\u00a0 </span>They have a tendency to buy into the leftist narrative according to which the current wave of populist and patriotic sentiment in the United States and Western Europe is merely an expression of racism and xenophobia.<span>\u00a0 </span>This is deeply unjust, contrary to Catholic teaching, and politically dangerous.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is unjust and contrary to Catholic teaching because, again, both natural law and traditional moral theology affirm that a desire to preserve one\u2019s nation and its culture are natural human sentiments and morally praiseworthy.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is dangerous because, when governing authorities fail to respect and take account of these natural and decent human sentiments, they are <i>inviting</i> rather than preventing a nationalist overreaction. </span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>(President Trump has famously called himself a \u201cnationalist,\u201d which is unfortunate given the connotations of that term.<span>\u00a0 </span>However, from <span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/future-does-not-belong-globalists-trump-pushes-nationalism-u-n-n1058171\">his 2019 address to the United Nations</a></span> it seems clear that what he means by this is just the defense of the institution of the nation against those who would dissolve it in the name of globalism, open borders, etc.<span>\u00a0 </span>Moreover, he explicitly affirmed the right of <i>every</i> nation to preserve itself and its sovereignty, and the right of <i>every</i>human being to have a special patriotic love and preference for his own country.<span>\u00a0 </span>He also has repeatedly called for the United States to refrain from intervening in the affairs of other nations.<span>\u00a0 </span>So it is evident that it is really just <i>patriotism</i> in the sense described above, rather than some sort of American nationalism, that he intends to promote.)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The current controversy over illegal immigration must be understood in light of these principles.<span>\u00a0 </span>In <span><a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/messages/migration/documents/hf_jp-ii_mes_25071995_undocumented_migrants.html\">a 1996 message on World Migration Day</a></span>, John Paul II emphasized the need to welcome migrants, to take account of the dangerous circumstances they are sometimes fleeing, to avoid all racist and xenophobic attitudes, and so on.<span>\u00a0 </span>At the same time, he acknowledged that \u201cmigration is assuming the features of a social emergency, above all because of the increase in\u00a0<i>illegal migrants\u201d</i><span> (emphasis in the original), and that the problem is</span> \u201cdelicate and complex.\u201d<span>\u00a0 </span>He affirmed that \u201cillegal immigration should be prevented\u201d and that one reason it is problematic is that \u201cthe supply of foreign labour is becoming excessive in comparison to the needs of the economy, which already has difficulty in absorbing its domestic workers.\u201d<span>\u00a0 </span>And he stated that in some cases, it may be necessary to advise migrants \u201cto seek acceptance in other countries, or to return to their own country.\u201d</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The Catechism promulgated by Pope John Paul II <span><a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a4.htm\">teaches that</a></span>:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><i><span>The more prosperous nations are obliged, <b>to the extent they are able,</b>to welcome the\u00a0<span>foreigner\u00a0</span>in search of the security and the means of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of origin. Public authorities should see to it that the natural right is respected that places a guest under the protection of those who receive him.</span></i></div><div><i><span><br></span></i></div><div><b><i><span>Political authorities, for the sake of the common good for which they are responsible,</span></i></b><i><span> <b>may make the exercise of the right to immigrate subject to various juridical conditions,</b> especially with regard to the immigrants' duties toward their country of adoption. <b>Immigrants are obliged to respect with gratitude the material and spiritual heritage of the country that receives them, to obey its laws and to assist in carrying civic burdens</b></span></i><b><span>.</span></b><span><span>\u00a0 </span>(Emphasis added)</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>End quote.<span>\u00a0 </span>Note that the Catechism teaches that immigrants have a <i>duty</i> to respect the laws and \u201cspiritual heritage\u201d of the nation they seek to enter, and that political authorities may restrict immigration so as to uphold the \u201ccommon good\u201d of the nation they govern.<span>\u00a0 </span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>Hence, there is no foundation in Catholic teaching for an open borders position, or for the position that those who seek to uphold the common culture and economic interests of their nation ought to be dismissed as racists and xenophobes.<span>\u00a0 </span>On the contrary, Catholic teaching <i>explicitly rules out</i> those positions.<span>\u00a0 </span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>There is a further implication of John Paul II\u2019s teaching.<span>\u00a0 </span>It isn\u2019t merely that having a special love for one\u2019s nation and its culture is natural and virtuous.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is that a <i>failure </i>to have it is <i>vicious</i> \u2013 a violation of the fourth commandment.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Of course, every nation has its faults, and aspects of its history of which one ought to be ashamed.<span>\u00a0 </span>For example, Germans are right to repudiate the Nazi period of their history, and Americans are right to repudiate slavery and segregation.<span>\u00a0 </span>But there is a mentality prevalent in the modern West that goes well beyond that \u2013 that insists on seeing nothing but evil in one\u2019s own nation and its culture and history.<span>\u00a0 </span>This is the mentality <span><a href=\"https://quillette.com/2019/10/07/oikophobia-our-western-self-hatred/\">sometimes called <i>oikophobia</i></a></span> \u2013 the hatred of one\u2019s own \u201chousehold\u201d (<i>oikos</i>), in the sense of one\u2019s own nation.<span>\u00a0 </span>One sees this mentality in Westerners who shrilly and constantly denounce their civilization as irredeemably racist, colonialist, etc., downplaying or denying its virtues, and comparing it unfavorably to other cultures \u2013 as if Western culture is somehow <i>more</i> prone to such failings than other cultures are, and as if it hasn\u2019t contributed enormously to the good of the world (both of which are absurd suppositions).</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Oikophobia is <i>evil</i>.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is a spiritual poison that damages both those prone to it (insofar as it makes them bitter, ungrateful, etc.) and the social order of which they are parts (insofar as it undermines the love and loyalty citizens need to have for their nation if it is to survive).<span>\u00a0 </span>It is analogous to the evil of hating and undermining one\u2019s own family.<span>\u00a0 </span>It is a violation of the fourth commandment.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The oikophobe sees his position as a remedy for nationalism, but in fact he is simply guilty of falling into an error that is the opposite extreme from that of the nationalist.<span>\u00a0 </span>Moreover, he is inadvertently <i>promoting</i> nationalism, because human beings have a tendency to overreact to one extreme by going too far in the other direction.<span>\u00a0 </span>Nationalism is bound to arise precisely as an overreaction against oikophobia.<span>\u00a0 </span>Those who are currently reacting to what they perceive as a resurgent nationalism by doubling down on oikophobia \u2013 pushing for open borders, indiscriminately denouncing their opponents as racists and xenophobes, etc. \u2013 are making a true nationalist backlash <i>more </i>likely, not less likely.<span>\u00a0 </span>The only true remedy for the evils of nationalism and oikophobia is, as John Paul II taught, the sober middle ground of patriotism.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>It is no accident that those prone to oikophobia tend to be precisely the same people as those who want to push further the sexual revolution, feminism, and the destruction of the traditional family and traditional sex roles that these entail.<span>\u00a0 </span>The same liberal individualist poison is at the core of all of these attitudes.<span>\u00a0 </span>As St. John Paul II said, \u201c<i>patria </i>is associated with the idea and the reality of \u2018father\u2019 (<i>pater</i>).\u201d<span>\u00a0 </span>Hatred of masculinity and of the paternal authority and responsibilities that are its fulfilment, hatred of the traditional family and of the sexual morality that safeguards it, and hatred of one\u2019s fatherland, are ultimately of a piece.<span>\u00a0 </span>And lurking beneath them all is a deeper hatred for another, heavenly Father.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Further

One is stay modern: use new APIs and tools that make the app better and easier to maintain. A second is to not spend time on things that don\u2019t make the app better. A third is to attract and retain contributors, who are usually more psyched to work with modern stuff than with old stuff.</p>\n<p>You can see how that\u2019s in a little bit of conflict with #1 (getting as many people as possible using RSS readers).</p>\n<h4>Here\u2019s the plan</h4>\n<p>After a major OS update, we will switch to requiring that update on our next major release \u2014\u00a0where major is defined as something like 5.0 or 5.1, but not something like 5.0.1. (In other words: the upcoming NetNewsWire 5.0.3 release will run on Mojave, while NetNewsWire 5.1 will require Catalina.)</p>\n<p>At the same time, we will make older versions available via the website. For instance, the last version that will run on Mojave will likely be 5.0.4 (which isn\u2019t finished yet) \u2014 and we\u2019ll make that version available indefinitely for people who haven\u2019t upgraded to Catalina.</p>\n<p>This will mean that people running older OSes will still get a high-quality app \u2014 it\u2019s just that it won\u2019t have the latest features.</p>\n<p>The key is that this allows us to make NetNewsWire the best app it can be, and making the best app we can is also part of furthering the goal of getting as many people as possible using RSS. (The biggest part, in fact. Bigger than compatibility with older OSes.)</p>\n<p>While I know this will disappoint some people, I hope you\u2019ll understand <em>why</em> we decided to do it this way. Decisions like this are never easy \u2014 there are always conflicting values to weigh, pros and cons and add up \u2014\u00a0and we don\u2019t make them impulsively. But making NetNewsWire the best app it can be has to be job #1.</p>"

the Auto Layout constraint you just added\nfixes that regression you found.\nIt didn\u2019t, of course,\nso you jump back into Xcode,\ntweak the Content Hugging Priority,\nhit

comic</a>,\nbut for those of us who don\u2019t so much relish in\nthe stop-and-go nature of app development,\nthere\u2019s an old Yiddish joke about Shlemiel the painter\n<em>(provided below with a few \uf8ff-specific modifications;\nfor the uninitiated,\nplease refer to Joel Spolsky\u2019s\n<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/11/back-to-basics/\">original telling</a>)</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shlemiel gets a job as a software developer,\nimplementing a new iOS app.\nOn the first sprint he opens Xcode\nand implements 10 new screens of the app.\n<em>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good!\u201d</em> says his manager,\n<em>\u201cyou\u2019re a fast worker!\u201d</em> and pays him a Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>The next sprint Shlemiel only gets 5 screens done.\n<em>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not nearly as good as yesterday,\nbut you\u2019re still a fast worker. 5 screens is respectable,\u201d</em>\nand pays him a Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>The next sprint Shlemiel implements 1 screen.\n<em>\u201cOnly 1!\u201d</em> shouts his manager.\n<em>\u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable!\nOn the first day you did ten times that much work!\nWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d</em> says Shlemiel.\n<em>\u201cEach sprint I get further and further away from\n<code>application(_:did<wbr>Finish<wbr>Launching<wbr>With<wbr>Options:)</code>!\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the years,\nthere have been some developments that\u2019ve helped things slightly,\nincluding\n<a href=\"https://nshipster.com/ibinspectable-ibdesignable/\"><code>@IBInspectable</code> and <code>@IBDesignable</code></a>\nand <a href=\"https://nshipster.com/xcplayground/\">Xcode Playgrounds</a>.\nBut with Xcode 11,\nour wait is finally over \u2014\nand it\u2019s all thanks to SwiftUI.</p>\n<hr>\n<aside>\n<p>The functionality described in this article requires the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Xcode 11</strong></li>\n<li><strong>macOS Catalina</strong></li>\n<li>\n<strong>iOS 13</strong> set as the <strong>Deployment Target</strong> for your app\u2019s <strong>Debug</strong> configuration <br>\n<em>(In Xcode, navigate your project\u2019s Build Settings;\nunder the Deployment heading,\nexpand the iOS Deployment Target setting and set Debug to iOS 13.0 or later)</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without these three things,\nyour code either won\u2019t compile or won\u2019t render live previews.</p>\n</aside>\n<hr>\n<p>Although many of us have taken a <a href=\"https://nshipster.com/wwdc-2019/\"><em>\u201cwait and see\u201d</em> approach</a> to SwiftUI,\nwe can start using its capabilities <strong>today</strong>\nto radically speed up and improve our development process \u2014\n<em>without changing a line of code in our UIKit apps</em>.</p>\n<p>Consider a subclass of <code>UIButton</code>\nthat draws a border around itself:</p>\n<pre data-lang=\"Swift\"><code><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Bordered<wbr>Button</span><span>:</span> <span>UIButton</span> <span>{</span>\n        <span>var</span> <span>corner<wbr>Radius</span><span>:</span> <span>CGFloat</span> <span>{</span> <var>...</var> <span>}</span>\n        <span>var</span> <span>border<wbr>Width</span><span>:</span> <span>CGFloat</span> <span>{</span> <var>...</var> <span>}</span>\n        <span>var</span> <span>border<wbr>Color</span><span>:</span> <span>UIColor</span><span>?</span> <span>{</span> <var>...</var> <span>}</span>\n        <span>}</span>\n        </code></pre>\n<p>Normally,\nif we wanted to test how our UI element performs,\nwe\u2019d have to add it to a view in our app,\nbuild and run,\nand navigate to that screen.\nBut with Xcode 11,\nwe can now see a preview side-by-side with the code editor\nby adding the following under the original declaration of <code>Bordered<wbr>Button</code>:</p>\n<div>\n<pre data-lang=\"Swift\"><code><span>#if can<wbr>Import(Swift<wbr>UI) &amp;&amp; DEBUG</span>\n

In our latest YouTube video, we went hands-on with both services to compare them.\n<br>\n<br>\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/klZfwC5Wh9I\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></center><center><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></center>\n<br>\nBoth <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/about/play-pass/\">Play Pass</a> are priced at $4.99 per month. Apple offers a one-month free trial while Google offers a 10-day free trial, but for the first year, Google is offering a deal that drops the price of Play Pass to $1.99 per month.\n<br>\n<br>\nThough the prices are similar, the two services are quite different. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a> features new and exclusive games, some of which were funded by Apple, while Google's Play Pass offers up older games.\n<br>\n<br>\nPlay Pass includes some super popular titles like Stardew Valley, Reigns, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, Terraria, and more, but the problem with older games is that many people may have already played them.\n<br>\n<br>\nPlay Pass is also not limited to games -- Google is including apps too. AccuWeather, Pic Stitch, ISS HD, and Tunable are some of the apps offered.\n<br>\n<br>\nApple Arcade only offers gaming titles, but all of the games are fresh, new, and exclusive to Apple Arcade. In some cases, though, some of the games are also available on consoles, but on mobile platforms, Apple Arcade gets exclusive access. That means no Android equivalent.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt's not clear if apps can leave Apple Arcade, but Google warns that apps can leave Play Pass. If that happens, users will need to buy the game to continue to use it if it's a paid game, and for free titles, ads and in-app purchases may show up.\n<br>\n<br>\nGoogle says there are hundreds of apps and games included with more being added every month. Apple Arcade launched with right around 60 games, and Apple has also promised new content on a monthly basis. Both services offer offline gaming, so no internet connection is required.\n<br>\n<br>\nWith both services, content is ad free and features no in-app purchases. Apple titles were designed from the ground up with no additional purchases, but for Play Pass, these gaming elements have been removed from titles that previously offered them.\n<br>\n<br>\nApple allows up to six family members to share games through a single Apple Arcade subscription using Family Sharing, and Google allows for up to five family members to share content through its Google Play Family Library.\n<br>\n<br>\nApple Arcade has launched in multiple countries around the world, while Play Pass is limited to the United States at the current time. Google does plan to expand, however.\n<br>\n<br>\nOne other aspect worth noting is privacy. Apple specifically mentions privacy protections and says that users are able to choose to share data, while Google's Play Pass materials don't mention privacy or data sharing. &quot;Every game must meet Apple's high privacy standards,&quot; reads Apple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-arcade-invites-you-to-play-something-extraordinary/\">press release</a> for Apple Arcade.\n<br>\n<br>\nMost people are locked in to either Android or iOS and few have both, so most people won't need to choose between services.\n<br>\n<br>\nApple users who have a Mac, iPhone, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> can access Apple Arcade on those devices, while Google Play Pass requires a smartphone, laptop, or tablet with Android 4.4 or above and Play Store version 16.6.25. Google Play Pass games can't be played on the larger screen of a television, which gives Apple Arcade a bit of an edge when it comes to non-mobile gaming.\n<br>\n<br>\nDo you prefer Apple Arcade with its fresh selection of titles, or Google Play Pass with its larger library of already available games?
