# How to import OPML

You can use an OPML subscription list to import your subscriptions from another app or service into NetNewsWire.

First you need to get an OPML file. This should be pretty easy – look for export options in the app or the service’s web site.

Once you’ve got the OPML file, NetNewsWire can make quick work of importing the items within.

1. From the menu bar, select **File → Import Subscriptions…**
2. If you have multiple accounts, select which account to receive the new subscriptions
3. Navigate to the OPML file’s location
4. Select it and click **Open**

NetNewsWire won’t replace your current subscription list. The new subscriptions will be added in addition to your current ones.
