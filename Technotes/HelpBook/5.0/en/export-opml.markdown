# How to export OPML

Your subscription list is portable, meaning you can easily switch to another app or service at any time. NetNewsWire can export an OPML file containing all your subscriptions. This file format is well-established and widely supported for just this purpose.

1. From the menu bar, select **File → Export Subscriptions…**
2. If you have multiple accounts, select which account’s subscriptions to export
3. Choose the name and location for the OPML file
4. Click **Export OPML**

Your subscriptions in NetNewsWire are unaffected by this action. Nothing is changed or removed.

You can now use this file for any app or service which allows you to import OPML-formatted subscription lists.
