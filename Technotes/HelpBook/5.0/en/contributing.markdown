# Contributing

NetNewsWire is open-source and contributions from the community are welcomed.

There are two channels for contributing. There is a Slack group for conducting discussions. For filing tickets, and contributing code or documentation, we use GitHub.



Slack

[Join the Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/netnewswire/shared_invite/enQtNjM4MDA1MjQzMDkzLTNlNjBhOWVhYzdhYjA4ZWFhMzQ1MTUxYjU0NTE5ZGY0YzYwZWJhNjYwNTNmNTg2NjIwYWY4YzhlYzk5NmU3ZTc) to talk with other NetNewsWire users — and to help out, if you’d like to, by testing, coding, writing, providing feedback, or just helping us think things through. Everybody is welcome and encouraged to join.



GitHub

The [NetNewsWire project on GitHub](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire) is the place to raise formal issues like bugs and feature requests.
