Well, it came and went, and only select models scored an upgraded wall charger. iPhone 11 remains stuck in the past with a slow 5W USB-A charger, while higher-end Pro models shipped with a faster and modern USB-C power block. That leaves us with the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2nh0tTN\">Anker PowerPort III Nano</a>. Described as the “world’s smallest USB-C wall charger” it packs more value and importance than ever before. I’ve been checking it out for a few weeks now following its <a href=\"https://9to5toys.com/2019/09/10/anker-powerport-iii-nano-announcement/\">announcement</a> earlier this month.
